<h2><span class="smcap">General Introduction.</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">The first of the following tracts was published
in the beginning of the year 1776;
and the second in the beginning of last year.
They are now offered to the public in one volume,
with corrections and additions. All the calculations,
in the <i>Appendix</i> to the first tract, have been
transferred to the <i>second</i> and <i>fourth</i> sections, in the
third part of the second tract.</p>

<p>The section on <span class="smcap">Public Loans</span>, in the second
tract, has been revised with care; and a <i>supplement</i>
to it, containing additional proposals and
some necessary explanations, has been given at the
end of the whole.—This is a subject to which
I have applied (perhaps too unprofitably) much
or my attention. I have now done with it; and
the whole is referred to the candid examination
of those who may be better informed, hoping
for their indulgence should they find that, in any
instance, I have been mistaken. I have not meant,
in any thing I have said on this subject, to censure
any persons. That accumulation of artificial debt
which I have pointed out, and by which the dagger
of the kingdom from its growing burdens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
has been so needlessly increased, has, I doubt not,
been the effect of inattention in our ministers;
and the scheme, by which the loan of last year
has been procured, gives reason to hope that better
plans of borrowing will be adopted for the
future.</p>

<p>The principal design of the first part of the
second tract was (as I have observed in the introduction
to it) to remove the misapprehensions
of my sentiments on <span class="smcap">Civil Liberty and Government</span>
into which some had fallen. It gives
me concern to find that it has not answered that
end in the degree I wished. I am still charged
with maintaining opinions which tend to subvert
all civil authority. I paid little regard to this
charge, while it was confined to the advocates for
the principles which have produced the present
war; but as it seems lately to have been given
the public from the authority of a writer of the
first character,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> it is impossible I should not be
impressed by it; and I find myself under a necessity
of taking farther notice of it.</p>

<p>There are two accounts, directly opposite to
one another, which have been given of the origin
of civil government. One of them is, that
“civil government is an expedient contrived by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
human prudence for gaining security against
oppression; and that, consequently, the power
of civil governors is a delegation or trust from
the people for accomplishing this end.”</p>

<p>The other account is, that “civil government
is an ordinance of the Deity, by which the
body of mankind are given up to the will of a
few; and, consequently, that it is a trust from
the Deity, in the exercise of which civil governors
are accountable only to him.”</p>

<p>The question “which of these accounts we ought
to receive,” is important in the highest degree.
There is no question which more deeply affects
the happiness and dignity of man as a citizen
of this world.—If the former account is
right, the people (that is, the body of independent
agents) in every community are their
own legislators. All civil authority is properly
<i>their</i> authority. Civil governors are only public
<i>servants</i>; and their power, being <i>delegated</i>, is by
its nature <i>limited</i>.—On the contrary. If the latter
account is right, the people have nothing to
do with their own government. They are placed
by their maker in the situation of cattle on an
estate, which the owner has a right to dispose of
as he pleases. Civil Governors are a body of
<i>masters</i>; and their power is a commission from
Heaven held by divine right, and unbounded in
its extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span></p>

<p>I have espoused, with some zeal, the first of
these accounts; and in the following tracts, endeavoured
to explain and defend it. And this
is <i>all</i> I have done to give countenance to the
charge I have mentioned.—Even the masterly
writer who, after a croud of writers infinitely his
inferiors, seems to have taken up this accusation
against me, often expresses himself as if he had
adopted the same idea of government<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. Such
indeed is my opinion of his good sense, and such
has been the zeal which he has discovered for
the rights of mankind, that I think it scarcely
possible his ideas and mine on this subject
should be very different. His language, however,
sometimes puzzles me; and, particularly,
when he intimates that government is an institution
of divine authority;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> when he scouts all
discussions of the nature of civil liberty, the foundation
of civil rights, and the principles of free
government; and when he asserts the <i>competence</i>
of our legislature to revive the <i>High-Commission
Court</i> and <i>Star-Chamber</i>, and its <span class="smcapuc">BOUNDLESS
AUTHORITY</span> not only over the people of <i>Britain</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
but over distant communities who have no voice
in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>But whatever may be Mr. <span class="smcap">Burke’s</span> sentiments
on this subject, he cannot possibly think of the
former account of government that “it is a
speculation which destroys all authority.”—Both
accounts establish an authority. The difference
is, that one derives it from the <i>people</i>, and makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
it a <i>limited</i> authority; and the other derives it
from <i>Heaven</i>; and makes it <i>unlimited</i>.—I have
repeatedly declared my admiration of such a
constitution of government as our own would be,
were the House of Commons a fair representation
of the kingdom, and under no undue influence.—The
sum of all I have meant to maintain
is, “that <span class="smcapuc">LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT</span>, as
opposed to <span class="smcapuc">OPPRESSION</span> and <span class="smcapuc">TYRANNY</span>, consists
in the dominion of equal laws made with
common consent, or of men over <i>themselves</i>;
and not in the dominion of communities over
communities, or of any men over other men.”
Introduction to the second Tract, <a href="#Page_2_9">p. 9</a>.—How
then can it be pretended, that I have aimed at
destroying all authority? Does our own constitution
destroy all authority? Is the authority of
equal laws made with common consent no authority?
Must there be no government in a state
that governs itself? Or, must an institution, contrived
by the united counsels of the members of
a community, for restraining licentiousness and
gaining security against injury and violence, <i>encourage</i>
licentiousness, and give to every one a
power to commit what outrages he pleases?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>The Archbishop of York, (in a sermon preached
before the society for propagating the gospel in
foreign parts, Feb. 21, 1777,) has taken notice of
some loose opinions, as he calls them, which have
been lately current on civil liberty; some who
mean delinquency having given accounts of it “by
which every man’s humour is made to be the
rule of his obedience, all the bad passions are
let loose, and those dear interests abandoned
to outrage for the protection of which we trust
in law,” 4to edit. p. 15 and 16. It is not
difficult to guess at one of the delinquents
intended in these words. In opposition to the
horrid sentiments of liberty which they describe,
but which in reality no man in his senses ever
entertained, the Archbishop defines it to be simply,
the supremacy of law, or <span class="smcapuc">GOVERNMENT</span> by <span class="smcapuc">LAW</span>,
without adding to <i>law</i>, as I had done, the words
<i>equal</i> and <i>made with common consent</i>;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and without
opposing a <span class="smcapuc">GOVERNMENT</span> by <span class="smcapuc">LAW</span> to a <span class="smcapuc">GOVERNMENT
BY MEN</span>, as others had done.—According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
to him, therefore, the supremacy of law
must be liberty, whatever the law is, or whoever
makes it.—In despotic countries government
by law is the same with government by the
will of one man, which <span class="smcap">Hooker</span> has called <i>the
misery of all men</i>; but, according to this definition,
it is liberty.—In <span class="smcap">England</span> <i>formerly</i>, the
law consigned to the flames all who denyed certain
established points of faith. Even <i>now</i>, it
subjects to fines, imprisonment and banishment
all teachers of religion who have not subscribed
the doctrinal articles of the church of England;
and the good Archbishop, not thinking the law
in this case sufficiently rigorous, has proposed
putting Protestant Dissenters under the same restraints
with the Papists.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And should this be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
done, if done by <i>law</i>, it will be the establishment
of <i>liberty</i>.</p>

<p>The truth is, that a government by law is or
is not liberty, just as the laws are just or unjust;
and as the body of the people do or do not participate
in the power of making them. The
learned Prelate seems to have thought otherwise,
and therefore has given a definition of liberty,
which might as well have been given of
slavery.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of his sermon, the Archbishop
adds words which he calls comfortable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
addressed to those who had been <i>patient in tribulation</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
and intimating that they might <i>rejoice
in hope</i>, “a ray of brightness then appearing
after a prospect which had been long dark.”
And in an account which follows the sermon,
from one of the missionaries in the province of
New-York, it is said, that “the rebellion would
undoubtedly be crushed, and that <span class="smcapuc">THEN</span> will
be the time for taking steps for the increase of
the church in America, by granting it an episcopate.”
In conformity to the sentiments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
this missionary, the Archbishop also expresses his
hope, that the opportunity which such an event
will give, for establishing episcopacy among the
colonists, will not be lost; and advises, that measures
should be thought of for that purpose,
and for thereby rescuing the church from the
persecution it has long suffered in <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>This is a subject so important, and it has been
so much misrepresented, that I cannot help going
out of my way to give a brief account of it.</p>

<p class="tb">It does not appear that the lay members themselves
of the church in <i>America</i> have ever wished
for Bishops. On the contrary, the assembly of <i>Virginia</i>
(the first episcopal colony) some years ago returned
thanks to two clergymen in that colony,
who had protested against a resolution of the other
clergy to petition for Bishops. The church <i>here</i>
cannot have a right to <i>impose</i> Bishops on the
church in another country; and therefore, while
churchmen in <i>America</i> are averse to Bishops, it
must be persecution to send Bishops among them.
The <i>Presbyterians</i>, and other religious sects there,
are willing, from a sense of the reasonableness
of toleration, to admit Bishops whenever the body
of episcopalian laity shall desire them, provided
security is given that they shall be officers merely
spiritual, possessed of no other powers than those
which are necessary to the full exercise of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
mode of religious worship. It is not Bishops, as
<i>spiritual</i> officers, they have opposed; but Bishops
on a state-establishment; Bishops with <i>civil</i> powers;
Bishops at the head of ecclesiastical courts, maintained
by taxing other sects, and possessed of a
<span class="smcapuc">PRE-EMINENCE</span> which would be incompatible with
the equality which has long subsisted among all
religious sects in <i>America</i>. In this last respect,
the colonies have hitherto enjoyed a happiness
which is unparalleled, but which the introduction
of such Bishops as would be sent from
hence would destroy. In <i>Pensilvania</i> (one of
the happiest countries under heaven before we
carried into it desolation and carnage) all sects
of christians have been always perfectly on
a level, the legislature taking no part with
any one sect against others, but protecting
all equally as far as they are peaceable. The
state of the colonies north of <i>Pensilvania</i> is much
the same; and, in the province of <i>Massachusett’s-Bay</i>
in particular, civil authority interposes no
farther in religion than by imposing a tax for
supporting public worship, leaving to all the
power of applying the tax to the support of that
mode of public worship which they like best.
This tax the episcopalians were, at one time,
obliged to pay in common with others; but so
far did the province carry its indulgence to them,
that an act was passed on purpose to excuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
them.—With this let the state of Protestant Dissenters
in this country be compared. Not only
are they obliged to pay tithes for the support of
the established church, but their worship is not
even tolerated, unless their ministers will subscribe
the articles of the church. In consequence
of having long scrupled this subscription, they
have lost all legal right to protection, and are exposed
to the cruellest penalties. Uneasy in such
a situation, they not long ago applied twice to
parliament for the repeal of the penal laws
against them. Bills for that purpose were brought
into the <i>House of Commons</i>, and passed that
House. But, in the House of Lords, they were
rejected in consequence of the opposition of the
Bishops.—There are few I reverence so much as
some on the sacred bench; but such conduct
(and may I not add the alacrity with which most
of them support the present measures?) must
leave an indelible stain upon them, and will probably
exclude them for ever from <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>On this occasion, I cannot help thinking with
concern of the learned Prelate’s feelings. After
a prospect long dark, he had discovered a ray of
brightness shewing him <i>America</i> reduced, and
the church triumphant: But lately, that ray of
brightness has vanished, and defeat has taken

<p><i>O the depth of the riches of the wisdom of God!
How unsearchable are his judgments!</i></p>

<p>But to proceed to another subject.</p>

<p class="tb">In the second of the following tracts, <a href="#Page_2_48">page
48</a>, I have observed, that in former times it
was the custom of parliament to pass bills for
appointing commissioners to take, state, and examine
the public accounts. I have lately had
it in my power to inform myself more particularly
on this subject; and I shall here beg leave
to give a brief recital of some of the principal
facts relating to it.</p>

<p>The first bill for the purpose I have mentioned
was passed in the times of the commonwealth,
and in the year 1653. It was called an
“act for accounts, and for clearing of public
debts, and discovering frauds and concealments.”
Seven commissioners were named in
it, and the necessary powers given them. In
1667, another act was passed for the same purpose;
after which I find no account of any such
acts till the beginning of the reign of King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
William. At this time complaints of mismanagement
and embezzlements in the disposition
of public money were become so prevalent, that
the <i>House of Commons</i> thought it necessary to enter
into measures for effectually preventing them, by
obliging all revenue officers to make up their
accounts, and bringing defaulters to justice.</p>

<p>With these views, six of the acts I have mentioned
were passed between the years 1690 and
1701. Another was passed in the first of Queen
<i>Anne</i>; and <i>three</i> more in her four last years.
In King <i>William</i>’s reign they were always passed by
the <i>House of Commons</i> without a division. In <i>Queen
Anne’s reign</i>, not <i>one</i> passed without a division. In
1717, a motion for such an act was <i>rejected</i> without
a division; and since 1717, only one motion<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
has been made for such a bill, and it was rejected
by a majority of 136 to 66.</p>

<p>The preamble to these acts declares the reason
of them to be, that “the kingdom may be
satisfied and truly informed, whether all the
monies granted by parliament have been faithfully
issued and applied to the end for which
they had been given; and that all loyal subjects
may be thereby encouraged more chearfully to
bear the burthens laid upon them.” The
number of commissioners named in them was
generally nine or seven, all members of the <i>House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
of Commons</i>. It was particularly ordered, that
they should take an account of all the revenues
brought into the receipt of the Exchequer, and
all arrears thereof; of all monies in the hands of
the receivers general of the land-tax, customs
and excise; of all the public stores, provisions,
&amp;c. as well for land as sea service; of all ships
of war, and the sums of money provided or paid
for the use of the forces by sea and land, and the
number of them respectively; and of any briberies
or corruptions in any persons concerned in
the receiving or disposing of the national treasure.
And, for these purposes, they were impowered
to call before them, and to examine upon
oath the officers of the exchequer, the secretary
at war, paymaster of the forces, commissioners
of the navy and ordnance, and all persons whatever
employed as commissioners, or otherwise, in
or about the <i>Treasury</i>.</p>

<p>The reports, which the commissioners thus appointed
delivered from time to time to parliament,
contain accounts of a waste of public
money, arising from the rapacity of contractors,
and many scandalous abuses and frauds in every
part of the public service, which must shock
every person not grown callous to all the feelings
of honesty and honour. In consequence of
these reports, the <i>House of Commons</i> addressed the
throne, and remonstrated; several great men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
were accused, and brought to shame; some were
dismissed from their places, and ordered to be
prosecuted; some expelled, and some committed
to the Tower. Thus did our representatives in
those times discharge their duty as guardians of
the public property; and it is, in my opinion,
only by such means that they are capable of
doing this properly and effectually. It must,
however, be acknowledged, that these commissions
of enquiry did not produce all the good
effects which might have been expected from
them. The influence of the crown, and the interest
in parliament of many great men entrusted
with the disposition of public money, rendered
the proper execution of them extremely difficult.
This led some even of the <i>Tories</i>, at the time
of the great change of ministry in 1710, to propose,
that the receiving and issuing of the public
money should be taken from the crown; and,
in defence of this proposal, it was urged, that
the issuing of public money, being in some of
the most despotic countries left in the hands of
the people, it was by no means a necessary part
of the royal prerogative. This would indeed
have provided a complete remedy; and it might
have perpetuated the constitution. But, even in
these times, it was a reformation too great and
too impracticable to engage much attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span></p>

<p>Ever since those times the public accounts have
been growing more complicated; and the temptations
to profusion and embezzlement have been
increasing with increasing luxury and dissipation.
How astonishing then is it that every idea of such
<i>commissions</i> should be now lost; and that, at a time
when the nation is labouring under expences almost
too heavy to be borne, the passing of accounts
by the <i>House of Commons</i> is become little
more than a matter of form; our representatives
scarcely thinking it worth their while to attend
on such occasions, and <span class="smcapuc">MILLIONS</span> of the public
treasure being sometimes given away, in a few
hours, just as proposed by the <i>Treasury</i>, without
debate or enquiry.</p>

<p>I must not forget to mention particularly on this
subject, that the commissioners named in the acts
I have described, were always declared incapable
of holding any place or office of profit under the
crown; and directed to take an account “of all
pensions, salaries, and sums of money paid
or payable to members of parliament out of
the revenue or otherwise.”—Not long before
this time, the <i>House of Commons</i> would not
suffer even the <i>Attorney-general</i><a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to sit and vote in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
the house because he was the king’s servant; and
in 1678, a member, as Mr. <i>Trenchard</i> says, was
committed to the Tower, for only saying in the
house that the king might keep guards for his
defence, if he could pay them.—Such <i>once</i> was
the House of Commons.—So jealous of the
power of the crown, and so chaste.—Since the
reign of Queen <i>Ann</i> and the passing of the <i>Septennial
Act</i>, a great change has taken place.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
A change which is little less than the total
ruin of the constitution, and which may end in
a tyranny the most oppressive and insupportable.
It is, therefore, the greatest evil, which could have
happened to us; and the men, by whose abominable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
policy it has been accomplished, ought to be
followed with the everlasting execrations of every
friend to public virtue and liberty.</p>

<p class="tb">I now withdraw to the situation of an anxious
spectator of public events; but before I do this,
I must leave with the public, at this threatening
period, the following sentiments.</p>

<p>Not long ago, the colonies might have been
kept, without bloodshed or trouble, by repealing
the <i>acts</i> which have made us the aggressors in the
present war; but <i>now</i> it would be great folly to expect
this.—At the same time I think it certain,
that they may be rendered more useful to us by
a pacification on liberal terms, which shall bind
them to us as <span class="smcap">Friends</span>, than by any victories
or slaughters (were they possible) which can
force them to submit to us as <span class="smcap">Subjects</span>.—I
think it also certain, that should the offer of
such terms be delayed till they have formed an
alliance with <i>France</i>, this country is <span class="smcapuc">UNDONE</span>.—Such
an alliance, we may hope, is not yet
settled.—Our rulers, therefore, may <i>possibly</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
have still a moment for pausing and retreating;
and every dictate of prudence and feeling
of humanity requires them to be speedy and
earnest in improving it.—But what am I saying?
I know this must not be expected. Too full of
ideas of our own dignity, too proud to retract;
and too tenacious of dominion, we seem determined
to persist: And the consequence must be,
that the colonies will become the allies of <i>France</i>;
that a general war will be kindled; and, perhaps,
this once happy country be made, in just retribution,
the seat of that desolation and misery
which it has produced in other countries.</p>

<p class="smaller">January 19, 1778.</p>

<p class="tb">Since the publication of the preceding
Introduction, the event referred to at the end of
it has been announced to the public. A memorial
from the <i>French</i> court has been delivered to
our court, declaring, that the former has concluded
a treaty of commerce and friendship with
the colonies as <span class="smcap">independent States</span>; and acquainting
us that, <span class="smcapuc">IN CONCERT WITH THEM</span>, the
King of France is determined and prepared to
defend his commerce against any interruption we
may give it.—A new turn, therefore, is now
given to our affairs of a nature the most critical
and alarming. Would to God there were any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
concessions by which we could extricate ourselves.
But the opportunities for this have been shamefully
lost, and cannot be now recovered.—With
a judicial blindness in our councils which has hitherto
carried us uniformly from <i>bad</i> to <i>worse</i>—With
near half our strength torn from us, and
our vaunted dignity in the dust—With our
resources failing; our credit tottering; and a
debt threatening to overwhelm us of more than a
<span class="smcapuc">HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLIONS</span>—In these circumstances,
we seem to be entering on a war
with the united powers of <i>France</i>, <i>Spain</i>, and
<i>America</i>.—This, should it happen, will complete
the measure of our troubles, and soon
bring on that <i>catastrophe</i> which there has been
all along reason to expect and dread.</p>

was generally expected. The truth, however,
is, that the war has operated in this way to a

<p>It should be observed, that though, in 1776,
there had been no importation of <i>tobacco</i>, yet the
duties on <i>tobacco</i> brought into the <i>Exchequer</i> as
much as ever, these duties having been paid for
old stock taken out of the warehouses for <i>home
consumption</i>, instead of <i>exportation</i>. This is one
of the causes which kept up the payments into
the <i>Exchequer</i> in 1776, notwithstanding a sudden
fall of near a <span class="smcapuc">MILLION AND A HALF</span> in the gross
receipt, and a <span class="smcapuc">MILLION</span> in the net receipt.—In
the last year, or 1777, the duties on tobacco
fell very short; and this contributed to diminish
the payments into the <i>Exchequer</i> near a
<i>quarter of a million</i>. But what seems of more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
importance is, that the debentures (or duties returned
at exportation) which had fallen in 1775
and 1776 above a <i>fourth</i>, continued to fall in
1777; and did not then amount to more than <i>two-fifths</i>
of the usual sum.</p>

<p>I have examined the customs from the Revolution
to the present time; but cannot find that
any thing like such a fall in them has ever happened
before.</p>

<h3>FIRST ADVERTISEMENT.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">The present state of the public funds makes it necessary
for me to acquaint the reader, that when
the <i>Supplement</i> to the following Tracts was written, the
3 <i>per cent.</i> annuities were at the price which the calculations
in it suppose, or nearly at 78. They have since
fallen to 72, and once even below 69, which is a lower
price than they were ever at during the whole last war,
except just at the pinch of the loan of twelve millions in
1762.—The difference of price also between them and
the new <i>4 per cents.</i> is fallen, (for no reason that I can
discover) from 14 to about 10½.—I find, likewise, that
in consequence of a distressing scarcity of money, the
subscribers to the last loan of <i>five millions</i> have not yet been
able to complete their payments.—These facts afford a
dark prospect; and make it doubtful whether, if things
don’t mend, it will be possible, by any schemes, to procure
the money necessary to bear the expence of another
campaign.—Should it happen, for these reasons, that
what I have written on loans can be of no use; or,
though capable of being of use, should it be neglected;
I shall still reflect with satisfaction, that I have now
given what I wished to offer on this subject with more
correctness; and proved, beyond a doubt, that a great
part of the National Debt is an <i>artificial</i> debt, for which
no money has been received, and which might have been
easily avoided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span></p>

<h3>SECOND ADVERTISEMENT.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Since the foregoing Advertisement in January last,
the price of the 3 <i>per cent.</i> annuities has fallen from
72 to 60½. But the difference of price between them and
the 4 <i>per cent.</i> annuities created in 1777, has risen to near
18l. agreeably to the true comparative value of these annuities,
as computed in <a href="#Page_1_14">page 14</a> of the Supplement.—It
is necessary I should farther mention, that there has
been a new loan of six millions for the service of the present
year; but that, contrary to my hopes, the managers
of our finances have returned to the old modes of borrowing—The
consolidated 3 <i>per cent.</i> annuities being,
when the loan was settled on the 6th of February, at
66½; one hundred 3 <i>per cent. stock</i> estimated at this price,
was given for every 100l. in <i>money</i>, with <span class="smcapuc">FOUR-FIFTHS</span>
of the profits of a lottery ticket reckoned at 2½l. and an
<span class="smcapuc">ANNUITY</span> of 2½l. for 30 years, reckoned worth 14 years
purchase (or 135l.) but really worth above 15 years purchase.
This made a profit of 4l. on every 100l. advanced.
But the 3 <i>per cent.</i> annuities falling immediately
to 64, and in a few days to 60½; and the short annuity
also happening to sell for no more than 13 years
purchase, this loan has been constantly at a discount,
which has fluctuated between 2 and 4½ <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p>The scheme of this loan is the first of the old schemes
described in the following Supplement, <a href="#Page_1_2">page 2d</a>; and it
is apparent that by including the value of the <i>douceurs</i>
in the capital, it brings on the public an artificial debt,
for which nothing will be received, of above two millions.—The
sum to be lent, should it be ever paid,
might have been as well obtained, without making any
material addition to the annual charge, by selling separately
the two <i>douceurs</i> worth 2.244,000l. and offering
for the remaining sum necessary to make up six millions,
an interest of five <i>per cent.</i> subject to the regulations
proposed in the Second Tract, <a href="#Page_2_98">page 98</a>, or in the Supplement,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Ibid. p. 55. Thoughts on the causes of the present
discontents, p. 67. “Government certainly, is an institution
of divine authority; though its <i>forms</i> and the <i>persons</i> who
administer it, all originate from the people.” It is probable
that Mr. <i>Burke</i> means only that government is a divine institution,
in the same sense in which any other expedient of
human prudence for gaining protection against injury, may
be called a Divine institution. All that we owe <i>immediately</i>
to our own foresight and industry, must <i>ultimately</i> be ascribed
to God the giver of all our powers, and the cause of all
causes. It is in this sense that St. Paul in Rom. xiii. 1, 2.
calls civil magistracy the <i>ordinance of God</i>, and says that <i>there
is no power but of God</i>. If any one wants to be convinced of
this, he should read the excellent bishop <span class="smcap">Hoadly</span>’s Sermon
entitled <i>The Measures of Submission to the civil Magistrate</i>, and
the defences of it.</p>

<p>It is further probable, that when Mr. <i>Burke</i> asserts the
<i>omnipotence</i> of Parliaments, or their <i>competence</i> to establish any
oppressions (Letter, p. 46, 49) he means mere <i>power</i> abstracted
from <i>right</i>, or the same sort of <i>power</i> and <i>competence</i>
that trustees have to betray their trust, or that armed ruffians
have to rob and murder. Nor should I doubt whether this
is his meaning, were it not for the passage I have quoted
from him in the last page, the latter part of which seems to
imply, that a legislature may contradict its <i>end</i>, and yet retain
its <i>rights</i>.—Some of the justest remarks on this subject
may be found in the Earl of <span class="smcap">Abingdon</span>’s thoughts on
Mr. <i>Burke</i>’s letter, a pamphlet which (on account of the excellent
public principles it maintains, and the spirit of
liberty it breathes, as well as the rank of the writer) must
give to every friend to the true interests of this country
particular pleasure.</p>

<p>In p. 46, Mr. <i>Burke</i> says, that “if there is one man in
the world more zealous than another for the supremacy of
parliament and the rights of this imperial crown, it is
himself; though many may be more knowing in the extent
and the foundation of these rights.” He adds,
that “he has constantly declined such disquisitions, not
being qualified for the chair of a professor in metaphysics,
and not chusing to put the solid interests of the kingdom
on speculative grounds.”—<i>The less knowledge, the
more zeal</i>, is a maxim which experience has dreadfully verified
in <i>religion</i>. But he that, in the present case, should apply
this maxim to Mr. <i>Burke</i>, would, whatever he may say of himself,
greatly injure him. Though he chuses to decry enquiries
into the nature of liberty, there are, I am persuaded, few
in the world whose zeal for it is more united to extensive
knowledge and an exalted understanding.—He calls it,
p. 55. “the vital spring and energy of a state, and a blessing
of the first order.” He cannot, therefore, think that too
much pains may be taken to <span class="smcapuc">UNDERSTAND</span> it. He must
know, that nothing but usurpation and error can suffer by
enquiry and discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilkes</span>, in an excellent speech which he lately made
in moving for the repeal of the declaratory law, observed,
that this law was a <i>compromise</i> to which the great men, under
whose administration it was passed, were forced in order to
obtain the repeal of the <i>Stamp-act</i>. I think so highly of that
administration and of the service it did the public, that I
have little doubt of the truth of this observation. But, at
the same time, I cannot help wishing Mr. <i>Burke</i> had given no
reason for doubt by defending the <i>principle</i> of that act; a
<i>principle</i> which, unquestionably, he and his friends would
never have acted upon; but which others have since acted upon,
with a violence which has brought us to the brink of ruin.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> In p. 19. he calls liberty “a freedom from all restraints
except such as established law imposes for <span class="smcapuc">THE
GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY</span>.” But this addition can
make no difference of any consequence, as long as it is not
specified <i>where</i> the power is lodged of judging what laws are
for the good of the community. In countries where the
<i>laws</i> are the <i>edicts</i> of absolute princes, the end professed is
always the good of the Community.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> “The laws against Papists have been extremely severe.
New dangers may arise; and if at any time <span class="smcapuc">ANOTHER
DENOMINATION</span> of men should be equally dangerous to
our civil interests, it would be justifiable to lay them
under similar restraints.” Page 17.—In another part of
this sermon the great men in opposition (some of the first in the
kingdom in respect of rank, ability, and virtue) are described
as a body of men void of principle, who, without regarding the
relation in which they stand to the community, have entered
into a league for advancing their private interest, and “who
are held together by the same bond that keeps together
the lowest and wickedest combinations.”—Was there
ever such a censure delivered from a pulpit? What wonder
is it that the Dissenters should come in for a share in his
Grace’s abuse?—Their political principles, he says, are
growing dangerous.—On what does he ground this insinuation?
He is mistaken if he imagines that they are all such
delinquents as the author of the following tracts, or that they
think universally as he does of the war with America. On
this subject they are, like other bodies of men in the kingdom,
of different opinions.—But I will tell him in what
they agree.—They agree in detesting the doctrines of
passive obedience and non-resistance. They are all <span class="smcap">Whigs</span>,
enemies to arbitrary power, and firmly attached to those
principles of civil and religious liberty which produced the
<span class="smcap">glorious Revolution</span> and the <span class="smcap">Hanoverian succession</span>.—Such
principles are the nation’s best defence; and
Protestant Dissenters have hitherto reckoned it their glory
to be distinguished by zeal for them, and an adherence to
them. <span class="smcap">Once</span> these principles were <i>approved</i> by men in
power. No good can be expected, if they are now reckoned
dangerous.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> That is, the missionaries of the society in America.—The
charter of the society declares the end of its incorporation
to be “propagating the gospel in foreign parts,
and making provision for the worship of God in those
plantations which wanted the administration of God’s
word and sacraments, and were abandoned to atheism
and infidelity.” The chief business, on the contrary, of
the society has been to provide for the support of <i>episcopalianism</i>
in the northern colonies, and particularly <span class="smcap">New-England</span>,
where the sacraments are more regularly administered,
and the people less abandoned to infidelity, than
perhaps in any country under heaven. The missionaries employed
and paid by the society for this purpose, have generally
been clergymen of the highest principles in church and
state. <i>America</i>, having been for some time very hostile to men
of such principles, most of them have been obliged to take
refuge in this country; and here they have, I am afraid,
been too successful in propagating their own resentments,
in misleading our rulers, and widening the breach which
has produced the present war.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> I am sorry to mention one exception to the fact
here intimated. The new constitution for <i>Pensilvania</i> (in
other respects wise and liberal) is dishonoured by a religious
test. It requires an acknowledgment of the divine
inspiration of the Old and New Testament, as a condition
of being admitted to a seat in the House of Representatives;
directing however, at the same time, that
no other religious test shall <i>for ever</i> hereafter be required
of any civil officer.—This has been, probably, an
accommodation to the prejudices of some of the narrower
sects in the province, to which the more liberal part have for
the present thought fit to yield; and, therefore, it may be expected
that it will not be of long continuance.</p>

<p>Religious tests and subscriptions in general, and all establishments
of particular systems of faith, with civil emoluments
annexed, do inconceivable mischief, by turning religion
into a trade, by engendering strife and persecution, by
forming hypocrites, by obstructing the progress of truth, and
fettering and perverting the human mind; nor will the world
ever grow much <i>wiser</i>, or <i>better</i>, or <i>happier</i>, till, by the abolition
of them, truth can gain fair play, and reason free
scope for exertion. The Archbishop, page 11, speaks of
christianity as “insufficient to rely on its own energies; and
of the assistances which it is the business of civil authority
to provide for gospel truths.”—A worse slander was
never thrown on gospel truths. Christianity disdains such
assistances as the corrupted governments of this world are
capable of giving it. Politicians and statesmen know little
of it. Their <i>enmity</i> has sometimes done it good; but their
<i>friendship</i>, by supporting corruptions carrying its name, has
been almost fatal to it.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Sir <span class="smcap">Francis Bacon</span> was the <i>second</i> <span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span>
who sat in the <i>House of Commons</i>; but, to prevent
its being drawn into a precedent, the House would not admit
him, till they had made an order, that no Attorney-General
should for the future be allowed to sit and vote in
that House.—In conformity to this order, whenever afterwards
a member was appointed Attorney-General, his place
was vacated, and a new writ issued. This continued to be
the practice till the year 1670, when Sir <span class="smcap">Heneage Finch</span>
(afterwards <span class="smcap">Earl of Nottingham</span>) being appointed Attorney-General,
he was allowed by connivance to preserve
his seat, which connivance has been continued ever since.—I
give these facts not from any enquiry or knowledge of my
own, but from the authority of a friend, who is perhaps better
informed than any person in the kingdom on every subject
of this kind.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The following facts will shew, in some degree, how this
change has been brought about.—For ten years ending
Aug. 1, 1717 (a period comprehending in it a general war
abroad; and the demise of the crown, the establishment of a
new family, and an open rebellion at home) the money expended
in secret services amounted only to 279,444l.—For
<span class="smcapuc">TEN YEARS</span> ending Feb. 11, 1742, it amounted to no
less a sum than 1.384,600; of which 50,077l. was paid to
printers of News-papers and writers for government; and a
greater sum expended, in the last <i>six weeks</i> of these ten years,
than had been spent in <i>three years</i> before Aug. 1710.—See
the Report of the <span class="smcap">Committee</span> appointed March 23, 1742,
to enquire into the conduct of <i>Robert Earl of Orford</i>,
printed in the Journals of the House of Commons, vol. 24, p.
295, 296, 300.—One passage, in this report, contains remarks,
so much to my present purpose and so important, that I cannot
help copying it.—“There are no laws particularly
adapted to the case of a minister who clandestinely employs
the money of the public, and the whole power and
profitable employments that attend the collecting and disposing
of it, <i>against</i> the people: And, by this profusion
and criminal distribution of offices, in some measure justifies
the expence that particular persons are obliged to be
at, by making it necessary to the preservation of all that
is valuable to a free nation. For in that case, the contest
is plain and visible. It is, whether the Commons shall
retain the <i>third</i> state in their own hands; while this
whole dispute is carried on at the expence of the people,
and, on the side of the minister, out of the money granted
to support and secure the constitutional independence of
the three branches of the legislature.—This method of
corruption is as sure, and, therefore, as criminal a way of
subverting the constitution as by an armed force. It is a
crime, productive of a total destruction of the very being
of this government; and is so <i>high</i> and <i>unnatural</i>, that nothing
but the powers of parliament can reach it; and, as
it never can meet with parliamentary animadversion but
when it is unsuccessful, it must seek for its <i>security</i> in the
extent and efficacy of the mischief it produces.” P. 395.
The obstructions which this committee met with in their enquiry
proved that the crime they here describe in such emphatical
language, had <i>even then</i> obtained that very security,
in the extent of the mischief it produced, which, they observe,
it was under a necessity of seeking.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The favourable reception which the
following Tract has met with, makes
me abundant amends for the abuse it has
brought upon me. I should be ill employed
were I to take much notice of this
abuse: But there is one circumstance attending
it, which I cannot help just mentioning.—The
principles on which I have
argued form the foundation of every state
as far as it is free; and are the same with
those taught by Mr. Locke, and all the
writers on Civil Liberty who have been hitherto
most admired in this country. But
I find with concern, that our Governors
chuse to decline trying by them their present
measures: For, in a Pamphlet which
has been circulated by government with
great industry, these principles are pronounced
to be “unnatural and wild, incompatible
with practice, and the offspring
of the distempered imagination of
a man who is biassed by party, and who
writes to deceive.”</p>

<p>I must take this opportunity to add, that
I love quiet too well to think of entering
into a controversy with any writers; particularly,
<span class="smcapuc">NAMELESS</span> ones. Conscious of
good intentions, and unconnected with any
party, I have endeavoured to plead the cause
of general liberty and justice: And happy
in knowing this, I shall, in silence, commit
myself to that candour of the public of
which I have had so much experience.</p>

<h2 id="I_PART_I">OBSERVATIONS,
&amp;c.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Our Colonies in <span class="smcap">North America</span> appear
to be now determined to risk and suffer
every thing, under the persuasion, that
<span class="smcap">Great Britain</span> is attempting to rob them of that
Liberty to which every member of society, and
all civil communities, have a natural and unalienable
title. The question, therefore, whether this
is a right persuasion, is highly interesting,
and deserves the careful attention of every
<i>Englishman</i> who values Liberty, and wishes to
avoid staining himself with the guilt of invading
it. But it is impossible to judge properly of this
question without just ideas of Liberty <i>in general</i>;
and of the nature, limits, and principles
of Civil Liberty <i>in particular</i>.—The following
observations on this subject appear to me
of some importance; and I cannot make myself
easy without offering them to the public at the
present period, big with events of the last consequence
to this kingdom. I do this, with reluctance
and pain, urged by strong feelings, but at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_2" id="Page_1_2">[2]</a></span>
time checked by the consciousness that I am likely
to deliver sentiments not favourable to the present
measures of that government, under which I live,
and to which I am a constant and zealous well-wisher.
Such, however, are my present sentiments
and views, that this is a consideration of inferior
moment with me; and, as I hope never to go beyond
the bounds of decent discussion and expostulation,
I flatter myself, that I shall be able to avoid
giving any person reason for offence.</p>

<p class="tb">The observations with which I shall begin, are
of a more general and abstracted nature; but being
necessary to introduce what I have principally
in view, I hope they will be patiently read and
considered.</p>

<h3 id="I_PART_I_SECT_I">SECT. I.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Nature of Liberty in General.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">In order to obtain a more distinct view of
the nature of Liberty as such, it will be useful
to consider it under the four following general
divisions.</p>

<p>First, <i>Physical</i> Liberty.—Secondly, <i>Moral</i>
Liberty.—Thirdly, <i>Religious</i> Liberty.—And
Fourthly, <i>Civil</i> Liberty.—These heads
comprehend all the different kinds of Liberty.
And I have placed <i>Civil</i> Liberty last, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_3" id="Page_1_3">[3]</a></span>
I mean to apply to it all I shall say of the
other kinds of Liberty.</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Physical Liberty</span> I mean that principle of
<i>Spontaneity</i>, or <i>Self-determination</i>, which constitutes
us <i>Agents</i>; or which gives us a command over our
actions, rendering them properly <i>ours</i>, and not
effects of the operation of any foreign cause.—<span class="smcap">Moral
Liberty</span> is the power of following, in all
circumstances, our sense of right and wrong; or
of acting in conformity to our reflecting and moral
principles, without being controuled by any contrary
principles.—<span class="smcap">Religious Liberty</span> signifies
the power of exercising, without molestation, that
mode of religion which we think best; or of making
the decisions of our own consciences respecting
religious truth, the rule of our conduct, and
not any of the decisions of our fellow-men.—In like
manner; <span class="smcap">Civil Liberty</span> is the power of a <i>Civil Society</i>
or <i>State</i> to govern itself by its own discretion,
or by laws of its own making, without being subject
to the impositions of <i>any</i> power, in appointing
and directing which the collective body of
the people have no concern, and over which they
have no controul.</p>

<p>It should be observed, that, according to these
definitions of the different kinds of liberty, there
is one general idea, that runs through them all;
I mean, the idea of <i>Self-direction</i>, or <i>Self-government</i>.—Did
our volitions originate not with <i>ourselves</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_4" id="Page_1_4">[4]</a></span>
but with some cause over which we have no
power; or were we under a necessity of always following
some will different from our own, we should
want <span class="smcap">Physical Liberty</span>.</p>

<p>In like manner; he whose perceptions of moral
obligation are controuled by his passions has lost
his <i>Moral Liberty</i>; and the most common language
applied to him is, that he wants <i>Self-government</i>.</p>

<p>He likewise who, in religion, cannot govern
himself by his convictions of religious duty, but is
obliged to receive formularies of faith, and to
practise modes of worship imposed upon him by
others, wants <i>Religious Liberty</i>.—And the Community
also that is governed, not by itself, but by
some will independent of it, wants <i>Civil Liberty</i>.</p>

<p>In all these cases there is a force which stands
opposed to the agent’s <i>own</i> will; and which, as
far as it operates, produces <i>Servitude</i>.—In the
<i>first</i> case, this force is incompatible with the very
idea of voluntary motion; and the subject of it is
a mere passive instrument which never <i>acts</i>, but is
always <i>acted upon</i>.—In the <i>second</i> case; this force
is the influence of passion getting the better of reason;
or the <i>brute</i> overpowering and conquering
the will of the <i>man</i>.—In the <i>third</i> case; it is
<i>Human Authority</i> in religion requiring conformity
to particular modes of faith and worship, and superseding
<i>private judgment</i>.—And in the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_5" id="Page_1_5">[5]</a></span>
case, it is any will distinct from that of the Majority
of a Community, which claims a power
of making laws for it, and disposing of its property.</p>

<p>This it is, I think, that marks the limit
between <i>Liberty</i> and <i>Slavery</i>. As far as, in
any instance, the operation of any cause comes
in to restrain the power of Self-government,
so far Slavery is introduced: Nor do I think that
a preciser idea than this of Liberty and Slavery
can be formed.</p>

<p class="tb">I cannot help wishing I could here fix my reader’s
attention, and engage him to consider carefully
the dignity of that blessing to which we give
the name of <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>, according to the representation
now made of it. There is not a word in the
whole compass of language which expresses so
much of what is important and excellent. It is,
in every view of it, a blessing truly sacred and invaluable.—Without
<i>Physical Liberty</i>, man would
be a machine acted upon by mechanical springs,
having no principle of motion in himself, or command
over events; and, therefore, incapable of all
merit and demerit.—Without <i>Moral Liberty</i>, he
is a wicked and detestable being, subject to the
tyranny of base lusts, and the sport of every vile
appetite.—And without <i>Religious</i> and <i>Civil Liberty</i>
he is a poor and abject animal, without rights,
without property, and without a conscience, bending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_6" id="Page_1_6">[6]</a></span>
his neck to the yoke, and crouching to the
will of every silly creature who has the insolence
to pretend to authority over him.—Nothing,
therefore, can be of so much consequence to us as
<i>Liberty</i>. It is the foundation of all honour, and
the chief privilege and glory of our natures.</p>

<p>In fixing our ideas on the subject of Liberty, it
is of particular use to take such an enlarged view
of it as I have now given. But the immediate object
of the present enquiry being <i>Civil Liberty</i>, I
will confine to it all the subsequent observations.</p>

<h3 id="I_PART_I_SECT_II">SECT. II.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of Civil Liberty and the Principles of Government.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">From what has been said it is obvious, that
all civil government, as far as it can be denominated
<i>free</i>, is the creature of the people. It
originates with them. It is conducted under their
direction; and has in view nothing but their happiness.
All its different forms are no more than so
many different modes in which they chuse to direct
their affairs, and to secure the quiet enjoyment
of their rights.—In every free state every man is
his own Legislator.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>—All <i>taxes</i> are free-gifts
for public services.—All <i>laws</i> are particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_7" id="Page_1_7">[7]</a></span>
provisions or regulations established by <span class="smcapuc">COMMON
CONSENT</span> for gaining protection and safety.—And
all <i>Magistrates</i> are Trustees or Deputies for
carrying these regulations into execution.</p>

<p>Liberty, therefore, is too imperfectly defined
when it is said to be “a Government by <span class="smcap">Laws</span>,
and not by <span class="smcap">Men</span>.” If the laws are made by one
man, or a junto of men in a state, and not by <span class="smcapuc">COMMON
CONSENT</span>, a government by them does not differ
from Slavery. In this case it would be a contradiction
in terms to say that the state governs itself.</p>

<p>From hence it is obvious that <i>Civil Liberty</i>, in
its most perfect degree, can be enjoyed only in
small states, where every independent agent is capable
of giving his suffrage in person, and of being
chosen into public offices. When a state becomes so
numerous, or when the different parts of it are removed
to such distances from one another, as to
render this impracticable, a diminution of Liberty
necessarily arises. There are, however, in these
circumstances, methods by which such near approaches
may be made to perfect Liberty as shall
answer all the purposes of government, and at the
same time secure every right of human nature.</p>

<p>Tho’ all the members of a state should not be
capable of giving their suffrages on public measures,
<i>individually</i> and <i>personally</i>, they may do this
by the appointment of <i>Substitutes</i> or <i>Representatives</i>.
They may entrust the powers of legislation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_8" id="Page_1_8">[8]</a></span>
subject to such restrictions as they shall think necessary,
with any number of <i>Delegates</i>; and whatever
can be done by such delegates within the limits
of their trust, may be considered as done by
the united voice and counsel of the Community.—In
this method a free government may be
established in the largest state; and it is conceivable
that by regulations of this kind, any number
of states might be subjected to a scheme of government,
that would exclude the desolations of war,
and produce universal peace and order.</p>

<p>Let us think here of what may be practicable
in this way with respect to <i>Europe</i> in particular.—While
it continues divided, as it is at present,
into a great number of independent kingdoms
whose interests are continually clashing, it is impossible
but that disputes will often arise which
must end in war and carnage. It would be no
remedy to this evil to make one of these states supreme
over the rest; and to give it an absolute
plenitude of power to superintend and controul
them. This would be to subject all the states to
the arbitrary discretion of one, and to establish an
ignominious slavery not possible to be long endured.
It would, therefore, be a remedy worse
than the disease; nor is it possible it should be approved
by any mind that has not lost every idea of
Civil Liberty. On the contrary.—Let every state,
with respect to all its internal concerns, be continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_9" id="Page_1_9">[9]</a></span>
independent of all the rest; and let a general
confederacy be formed by the appointment of
a <span class="smcap">Senate</span> consisting of Representatives from all
the different states. Let this <span class="smcap">Senate</span> possess the
power of managing all the <i>common</i> concerns of the
united states, and of judging and deciding between
them, as a common <i>Arbiter</i> or <i>Umpire</i>, in all
disputes; having, at the same time, under its direction,
the common force of the states to support its
decisions.—In these circumstances, each separate
state would be secure against the interference of foreign
power in its private concerns, and, therefore,
would possess <i>Liberty</i>; and at the same time it
would be secure against all oppression and insult
from every neighbouring state.—Thus might
the scattered force and abilities of a whole continent
be gathered into one point; all litigations settled
as they rose; universal peace preserved; and nation
prevented <i>from any more lifting up a sword
against nation</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">I have observed, that tho’, in a great state, all
the individuals that compose it cannot be admitted
to an immediate participation in the powers of
legislation and government, yet they may participate
in these powers by a delegation of them to a
body of representatives.—In this case it is evident
that the state will be still <i>free</i> or <i>self-governed</i>;
and that it will be more or less so in proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_10" id="Page_1_10">[10]</a></span>
as it is more or less fairly and adequately represented.
If the persons to whom the trust of government
is committed hold their places for short
terms; if they are chosen by the unbiassed voices
of a majority of the state, and subject to their instructions;
Liberty will be enjoyed in its highest
degree. But if they are chosen for long terms by
a part only of the state; and if during that term
they are subject to no controul from their constituents;
the very idea of Liberty will be lost, and the
power of chusing representatives becomes nothing
but a power, lodged in a <i>few</i>, to chuse at certain
periods, a body of <i>Masters</i> for themselves and for
the rest of the Community. And if a state is so
sunk that the majority of its representatives are
elected by a handful of the meanest<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> persons in
it, whose votes are always paid for; and if also,
there is a higher will on which even these mock representatives
themselves depend, and that directs
their voices: In these circumstances, it will be an
abuse of language to say that the state possesses Liberty.
Private men, indeed, might be allowed the
exercise of Liberty; as they might also under the
most despotic government, but it would be an <i>indulgence</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_11" id="Page_1_11">[11]</a></span>
or <i>connivance</i> derived from the spirit of the
times, or from an accidental mildness in the administration.
And, rather than be governed in
such a manner, it would perhaps be better to be
governed by the will of one man without any representation:
For a representation so degenerated
could answer no other end than to mislead and deceive,
by disguising slavery, and keeping up a <i>form</i>
of Liberty when the <i>reality</i> was lost.</p>

<p class="tb">Within the limits now mentioned, Liberty may
be enjoyed in every possible degree; from that
which is complete and perfect, to that which is
merely nominal; according as the people have
more or less of a share in government, and of a
controuling power over the persons by whom it is
administered.</p>

<p>In general, to be <i>free</i> is to be guided by one’s
own will; and to be guided by the will of another
is the characteristic of <i>Servitude</i>. This is particularly
applicable to Political Liberty. That state,
I have observed, is <i>free</i>, which is guided by its
own will; or, (which comes to the same) by the
will of an assembly of representatives appointed by
itself and accountable to itself. And every state
that is not so governed; or in which a body of
men representing the people make not an essential
part of the Legislature, is in <i>slavery</i>.—In order
to form the most perfect constitution of government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_12" id="Page_1_12">[12]</a></span>
there may be the best reasons for joining to
such a body of representatives, an <i>Hereditary Council</i>
consisting of men of the first rank in the state,
with a <i>Supreme executive Magistrate</i> at the head of
all. This will form useful checks in a legislature;
and contribute to give it vigour, union, and dispatch,
without infringing liberty: for, as long as
that part of a government which represents the
people is a <i>fair representation</i>; and also has a negative
on all public measures, together with the
sole power of imposing taxes and originating supplies;
the essentials of liberty will be preserved.—We
make it our boast in this country, that
this is our own constitution. I will not say with
how much reason.</p>

<p class="tb">Of such Liberty as I have now described, it
is impossible there should be an excess. Government
is an institution for the benefit of the
people governed, which they have power to model
as they please; and to say, that they can have
too much of this power, is to say, that there ought
to be a power in the state superior to that which
gives it being, and from which all jurisdiction in
it is derived.—Licentiousness, which has been
commonly mentioned, as an extreme of liberty, is
indeed its opposite. It is government by the will
of rapacious individuals, in opposition to the will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_13" id="Page_1_13">[13]</a></span>
of the community, made known and declared in
the laws. A free state, at the same time that it is
free itself, makes all its members free, by excluding
licentiousness, and guarding their persons and
property and good name against insult. It is the
end of all just government, at the same time that
it secures the liberty of the public against <i>foreign</i>
injury, to secure the liberty of the individual
against <i>private</i> injury. I do not, therefore, think
it strictly just to say, that it belongs to the nature
of government to entrench on private liberty. It
ought never to do this, except as far as the exercise
of private liberty encroaches on the liberties of
others. That is; it is licentiousness it restrains, and
liberty itself only when used to destroy liberty.</p>

<p>It appears from hence, that licentiousness and
despotism are more nearly allied than is commonly
imagined. They are both alike inconsistent with
liberty, and the true end of government; nor is
there any other difference between them, than
that the one is the licentiousness of <i>great</i> men, and
the other the licentiousness of <i>little</i> men; or that,
by the one, the persons and property of a people
are subject to outrage and invasion from a King, or
a lawless body of <i>Grandees</i>; and that, by the other,
they are subject to the like outrage from a <i>lawless
mob</i>.—In avoiding one of these evils, mankind
have often run into the other. But all well constituted
governments guard equally against both.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_14" id="Page_1_14">[14]</a></span>
Indeed of the two, the last is, on several accounts,
the least to be dreaded, and has done the least
mischief. It may be truly said, that if licentiousness
has destroyed its thousands, despotism has destroyed
its millions. The former, having little
power, and no system to support it, necessarily
finds its own remedy; and a people soon get out
of the tumult and anarchy attending it. But a
despotism, wearing the form of government, and
being armed with its force, is an evil not to be
conquered without dreadful struggles. It goes on
from age to age, debasing the human faculties, levelling
all distinctions, and preying on the rights
and blessings of society.—It deserves to be added,
that in a state disturbed by licentiousness, there
is an animation which is favourable to the human
mind, and which puts it upon exerting its powers.
But in a state habituated to a despotism, all is still
and torpid. A dark and savage tyranny stifles
every effort of genius; and the mind loses all its
spirit and dignity.</p>

<p class="tb">Before I proceed to what I have farther in view,
I will observe, that the account now given of the
principles of public Liberty, and the nature of an
equal and free government, shews what judgment
we should form of that <span class="smcapuc">OMNIPOTENCE</span>, which, it
has been said, must belong to every government
as such. Great stress has been laid on this, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_15" id="Page_1_15">[15]</a></span>
most unreasonably.—Government, as has been
before observed, is, in the very nature of it, a
<span class="smcap">Trust</span>; and all its powers a <span class="smcapuc">DELEGATION</span> for
gaining particular ends. This <i>trust</i> may be misapplied
and abused. It may be employed to defeat
the very ends for which it was instituted; and
to subvert the very rights which it ought to protect.—A
<span class="smcap">Parliament</span>, for instance, consisting
of a body of representatives, chosen for a limited
period, to make laws, and to grant money for public
services, would forfeit its authority by making
itself perpetual, or even prolonging its own duration;
by nominating its own members; by accepting
bribes; or subjecting itself to any kind of foreign
influence. This would convert a <i>Parliament</i>
into a <i>conclave</i> or <i>junto</i> of self-created tools;
and a state that has lost its regard to its own rights,
so far as to submit to such a breach of trust in its
rulers, is enslaved.—Nothing, therefore, can be
more absurd than the doctrine which some have
taught, with respect to the omnipotence of parliaments.
They possess no power beyond the limits of
the trust for the execution of which they were
formed. If they contradict this trust, they betray
their constituents, and dissolve themselves. All delegated
power must be subordinate and limited.—If
omnipotence can, with any sense, be ascribed to
a legislature, it must be lodged where all legislative
authority originates; that is, in the <span class="smcap">People</span>. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_16" id="Page_1_16">[16]</a></span>
<i>their</i> sakes government is instituted; and their’s
is the only real omnipotence.</p>

<p class="tb">I am sensible, that all I have been saying would
be very absurd, were the opinions just which some
have maintained concerning the origin of government.
According to these opinions, government
is not the creature of the people, or the result of
a convention between them and their rulers: But
there are certain men who possess in themselves,
independently of the will of the people, a right of
governing them, which they derive from the
Deity. This doctrine has been abundantly refuted
by many<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> excellent writers. It is a doctrine
which avowedly subverts Civil Liberty; and which
represents mankind as a body of vassals, formed to
descend like cattle from one set of owners to another,
who have an absolute dominion over them.
It is a wonder, that those who view their species
in a light so humiliating, should ever be able to
think of themselves without regret and shame.
The intention of these observations is not to oppose
such sentiments; but, taking for granted the reasonableness
of Civil Liberty, to shew wherein it
consists, and what distinguishes it from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_17" id="Page_1_17">[17]</a></span>
contrary.—And, in considering this subject, as it
has been now treated, it is unavoidable to reflect
on the excellency of a free government, and its
tendency to exalt the nature of man.—Every
member of a free state, having his property secure,
and knowing himself his own governor, possesses
a consciousness of dignity in himself, and feels incitements
to emulation and improvement, to which
the miserable slaves of arbitrary power must be utter
strangers. In such a state all the springs of action
have room to operate, and the mind is stimulated
to the noblest exertions<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.—But to be obliged,
from our birth, to look up to a creature no
better than ourselves as the master of our fortunes;
and to receive his will as our law—What can be
more humiliating? What elevated ideas can enter
a mind in such a situation?—Agreeably to this
remark; the subjects of free states have, in all
ages, been most distinguished for genius and knowledge.
Liberty is the soil where the arts and sciences
have flourished; and the more free a state has
been, the more have the powers of the human
mind been drawn forth into action, and the greater
number of brave men has it produced. With what
lustre do the antient free states of <i>Greece</i> shine
in the annals of the world? How different is that
country now, under the Great <i>Turk</i>? The difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_18" id="Page_1_18">[18]</a></span>
between a country inhabited by men and by
brutes is not greater.</p>

<p>These are reflexions which should be constantly
present to every mind in this country.—As <i>Moral</i>
Liberty is the prime blessing of man in his
<i>private</i> capacity, so is <i>Civil</i> liberty in his <i>public</i>
capacity. There is nothing that requires more to
be <i>watched</i> than power. There is nothing that
ought to be opposed with a more determined resolution
than its encroachments. Sleep in a state, as
<i>Montesquieu</i> says, is always followed by slavery.</p>

<p>The people of this kingdom were once warmed
by such sentiments as these. Many a sycophant of
power have they sacrificed. Often have they
fought and bled in the cause of Liberty. But that
time seems to be going. The fair inheritance of
Liberty left us by our ancestors many of us are
willing to resign. An abandoned venality, the
inseparable companion of dissipation and extravagance,
has poisoned the springs of public virtue
among us: And should any events ever arise that
should render the same opposition necessary that
took place in the times of King <i>Charles</i> the First,
and <i>James</i> the Second, I am afraid all that is valuable
to us would be lost. The terror of the standing
army, the danger of the public funds, and the
all-corrupting influence of the treasury, would
deaden all zeal, and produce general acquiescence
and servility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_19" id="Page_1_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="I_PART_I_SECT_III">SECT. III.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Authority of one Country over another.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">From the nature and principles of Civil Liberty,
as they have been now explained, it
is an immediate and necessary inference that no
one community can have any power over the property
or legislation of another community, which
is not incorporated with it by a just and adequate
representation.—Then only, it has been shewn,
is a state <i>free</i>, when it is governed by its own will.
But a country that is subject to the legislature of
another country, in which it has no voice, and
over which it has no controul, cannot be said to be
governed by its own will. Such a country, therefore,
is in a state of slavery. And it deserves to be
particularly considered, that such a slavery is worse,
on several accounts, than any slavery of private
men to one another, or of kingdoms to despots
within themselves.—Between one state and another,
there is none of that fellow-feeling that takes
place between persons in private life. Being detached
bodies that never see one another, and residing
perhaps in different quarters of the globe,
the state that governs cannot be a witness to the
sufferings occasioned by its oppressions; or a competent
judge of the circumstances and abilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_20" id="Page_1_20">[20]</a></span>
of the people who are governed. They must
also have in a great degree separate interests; and
the more the one is loaded, the more the other
may be eased. The infamy likewise of oppression,
being in such circumstances shared among a multitude,
is not likely to be much felt or regarded.—On
all these accounts there is, in the case
of one country subjugated to another, little or
nothing to check rapacity; and the most flagrant
injustice and cruelty may be practised without remorse
or pity.—I will add, that it is particularly
difficult to shake off a tyranny of this kind. A
single despot, if a people are unanimous and resolute,
may be soon subdued. But a despotic state
is not easily subdued; and a people subject to it
cannot emancipate themselves without entering
into a dreadful, and, perhaps, very unequal contest.</p>

<p>I cannot help observing farther, that the slavery
of a people to internal despots may be qualified
and limited; but I don’t see what can limit the
authority of one state over another. The exercise
of power in this case can have no other measure
than discretion; and, therefore, must be indefinite
and absolute.</p>

<p class="tb">Once more. It should be considered that the
government of one country by another, can only
be supported by a military force; and, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_21" id="Page_1_21">[21]</a></span>
such a support, must be destitute of all weight
and efficiency.</p>

<p>This will be best explained by putting the following
case.—There is, let us suppose, in a province
subject to the sovereignty of a distant state,
a subordinate legislature consisting of an Assembly
chosen by the people; a Council chosen by that
Assembly; and a Governor <i>appointed</i> by the Sovereign
state, and paid by the Province. There
are, likewise, judges and other officers, appointed
and paid in the same manner, for administering
<i>justice</i> agreeably to the laws, by the verdicts of juries
fairly chosen.—This forms a constitution
seemingly free, by giving the people a share in
their own government, and some check on their
rulers. But, while there is a higher legislative
power, to the controul of which such a constitution
is subject, it does not itself possess Liberty,
and therefore cannot be of any use as a security
to Liberty; nor is it possible that it should
be of long duration. Laws offensive to the Province
will be enacted by the Sovereign State. The
legislature of the Province will remonstrate against
them. The magistrates will not execute them.
Juries will not convict upon them; and consequently,
like the Pope’s Bulls which once governed
<i>Europe</i>, they will become nothing but
forms and empty sounds, to which no regard will
be shewn.—In order to remedy this evil, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_22" id="Page_1_22">[22]</a></span>
to give efficiency to its government, the supreme
state will naturally be led to withdraw the <i>Governor</i>,
the <i>Council</i>, and the <i>Judges</i><a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> from the controul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_23" id="Page_1_23">[23]</a></span>
of the Province, by making them entirely dependant
on itself for their <i>pay</i> and <i>continuance in office</i>,
as well as for their appointment. It will also alter
the mode of chusing Juries on purpose to bring
them more under its influence: And in some cases,
under the pretence of the impossibility of gaining
an impartial trial where government is resisted, it
will perhaps ordain, that offenders shall be removed
from the Province to be tried within its own territories:
And it may even go so far in this kind of
policy, as to endeavour to prevent the effects of
discontents, by forbidding all meetings and associations
of the people, except at such times, and
for such particular purposes, as shall be permitted
them.</p>

<p>Thus will such a Province be exactly in the
same state that <i>Britain</i> would be in, were our first
executive magistrate, our House of Lords, and
our Judges, nothing but the instruments of a foreign
democratical power; were our Juries nominated
by that power; or were we liable to be
transported to a distant country to be tried for
offences committed here, and restrained from calling
any meetings, consulting about any grievances,
or associating for any purposes, except
when leave should be given us by a <i>Lord Lieutenant</i>
or <i>Viceroy</i>.</p>

<p>It is certain that this is a state of oppression
which no country could endure, and to which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_24" id="Page_1_24">[24]</a></span>
would be vain to expect, that any people should
submit an hour without an armed force to compel
them.</p>

<p>The late transactions in <i>Massachuset’s Bay</i> are
a perfect exemplification of what I have now said.
The government of <i>Great Britain</i> in that Province
has gone on exactly in the train I have described;
till at last it became necessary to station troops
there, not amenable to the civil power; and all
terminated in a government by the <span class="smcap">Sword</span>. And
such, if a people are not sunk below the character
of men, will be the issue of all government in similar
circumstances.</p>

<p class="tb">It may be asked—“Are there not causes by
which one state may acquire a <i>rightful</i> authority
over another, though not consolidated by an adequate
Representation?”—I answer, that there
are no such causes.—All the causes to which
such an effect <i>can</i> be ascribed are <span class="smcap">Conquest</span>, <span class="smcap">Compact</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Obligations conferred</span>.</p>

<p>Much has been said of the right of <i>conquest</i>;
and history contains little more than accounts of
kingdoms reduced by it under the dominion of
other kingdoms, and of the havock it has made
among mankind. But the authority derived from
hence, being founded on violence, is never <i>rightful</i>.
The <i>Roman Republic</i> was nothing but a faction
against the general liberties of the world; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_25" id="Page_1_25">[25]</a></span>
had no more right to give law to the Provinces
subject to it, than thieves have to the property
they seize, or to the houses into which they break.—Even
in the case of a just war undertaken by
one people to defend itself against the oppressions
of another people, conquest gives only a right to
an indemnification for the injury which occasioned
the war, and a reasonable security against future
injury.</p>

<p>Neither can any state acquire such an authority
over other states in virtue of any <i>compacts</i> or <i>cessions</i>.
This is a case in which compacts are not
binding. <i>Civil</i> Liberty is, in this respect, on the
same footing with <i>Religious</i> Liberty. As no people
can lawfully surrender their <i>Religious</i> Liberty,
by giving up their right of judging for themselves
in religion, or by allowing any human beings to
prescribe to them what faith they shall embrace,
or what mode of worship they shall practise; so
neither can any civil societies lawfully surrender
their <i>Civil</i> Liberty, by giving up to any extraneous
jurisdiction their power of legislating for themselves
and disposing their property. Such a cession,
being inconsistent with the unalienable rights
of human nature, would either not bind at all;
or bind only the individuals who made it. This
is a blessing which no one generation of men can
give up for another; and which, when lost, a people
have always a right to resume.—Had our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_26" id="Page_1_26">[26]</a></span>
ancestors in this country been so mad as to have
subjected themselves to any foreign Community,
we could not have been under any obligation to
continue in such a state. And all the nations now
in the world who, in consequence of the tameness
and folly of their predecessors, are subject to arbitrary
power, have a right to emancipate themselves
as soon as they can.</p>

<p>If neither <i>conquest</i> nor <i>compact</i> can give such an
authority, much less can any favours received, or
any services performed by one state for another.—Let
the favour received be what it will, Liberty
is too dear a price for it. A state that has
been <i>obliged</i> is not, therefore, bound to be <i>enslaved</i>.
It ought, if possible, to make an adequate return
for the services done to it; but to suppose that it
ought to give up the power of governing itself, and
the disposal of its property, would be to suppose,
that, in order to shew its gratitude, it ought to part
with the power of ever afterwards exercising gratitude.—How
much has been done by this kingdom
for <i>Hanover</i>? But no one will say that on this
account, we have a right to make the laws of <i>Hanover</i>;
or even to draw a single penny from it without
its own consent.</p>

<p class="tb">After what has been said it will, I am afraid,
be trifling to apply the preceding arguments to
the case of different communities, which are considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_27" id="Page_1_27">[27]</a></span>
as different parts of the same <i>Empire</i>. But
there are reasons which render it necessary for me
to be explicit in making this application.</p>

<p>What I mean here is just to point out the difference
of situation between communities forming
an <i>Empire</i>; and particular bodies or classes of men
forming different parts of a <i>Kingdom</i>. Different
communities forming an <i>Empire</i> have no connexions,
which produce a necessary reciprocation
of interests between them. They inhabit different
districts, and are governed by different legislatures.—On
the contrary. The different classes of
men <i>within a kingdom</i> are all placed on the same
ground. Their concerns and interests are the
same; and what is done to one part must affect all.—These
are situations totally different; and a
constitution of government that may be consistent
with Liberty in one of them, may be entirely inconsistent
with it in the other. It is, however,
certain that, even in the last of these situations, no
one part ought to govern the rest. In order to a
fair and equal government, there ought to be a
fair and equal representation of all that are governed;
and as far as this is wanting in any government,
it deviates from the principles of Liberty,
and becomes unjust and oppressive.—But in
the circumstances of different communities, all this
holds with unspeakably more force. The government
of a part in this case becomes complete tyranny;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_28" id="Page_1_28">[28]</a></span>
and subjection to it becomes complete slavery.</p>

<p class="tb">But ought there not, it is asked, to exist somewhere
in an <i>Empire</i> a supreme legislative authority
over the whole; or a power to controul and bind
all the different states of which it consists?—This
enquiry has been already answered. The truth is,
that such a supreme controuling power ought to
exist no-where except in such a <span class="smcap">Senate</span> or body
of delegates as that described in <a href="#Page_1_8">page 8</a>; and
that the authority or supremacy of even this senate
ought to be limited to the common concerns of the
<i>Empire</i>.—I think I have proved that the fundamental
principles of Liberty necessarily require
this.</p>

<p>In a word. An <i>Empire</i> is a collection of states
or communities united by some common bond or
tye. If these states have each of them free constitutions
of government, and, with respect to taxation
and internal legislation, are independent of
the other states, but united by compacts, or alliances,
or subjection to a Great <i>Council</i>, representing
the whole, or to one monarch entrusted with the
supreme executive power: In these circumstances,
the Empire will be an Empire of Freemen.—If,
on the contrary, like the different provinces subject
to the <i>Grand Seignior</i>, none of the states possess
any independent legislative authority; but are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_29" id="Page_1_29">[29]</a></span>
subject to an absolute monarch, whose will is their
law; then is the Empire an Empire of Slaves.—If
one of the states is free, but governs by its will
all the other states; then is the Empire, like that
of the Romans in the times of the republic, an
Empire consisting of one state free, and the rest in
slavery: Nor does it make any more difference in
this case, that the governing state is itself free,
than it does, in the case of a kingdom subject to
a <i>despot</i>, that this despot is himself free. I have
before observed, that this only makes the slavery
worse. There is, in the one case, a chance, that, in
the quick succession of despots, a good one will
sometimes arise. But bodies of men continue the
same; and have generally proved the most unrelenting
of all tyrants.</p>

<p>A great writer before<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> quoted, observes of
the <i>Roman Empire</i>, that while Liberty was at the
center, tyranny prevailed in the distant provinces;
that such as were free under it were extremely so,
while those who were slaves groaned under the
extremity of slavery; and that the same events that
<i>destroyed</i> the liberty of the former, <i>gave</i> liberty to
the latter.</p>

<p>The Liberty of the <i>Romans</i>, therefore, was only
an additional calamity to the provinces governed
by them; and though it might have been said of
the <i>citizens</i> of <i>Rome</i>, that they were the “freest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_30" id="Page_1_30">[30]</a></span>
members of any civil society in the known
world;” yet of the <i>subjects</i> of <i>Rome</i>, it must
have been said, that they were the completest
slaves in the known world.—How remarkable
is it, that this very people, once the freest of
mankind, but at the same time the most proud and
tyrannical, should become at last the most contemptible
and abject slaves that ever existed?</p>

<h2 id="I_PART_II">PART II.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">In the foregoing disquisitions, I have, from one
leading principle, deduced a number of consequences,
that seem to me incapable of being disputed.
I have meant that they should be applied
to the great question between this kingdom and
the Colonies which has occasioned the present war
with them.</p>

<p>It is impossible, but my readers must have
been all along making this application; and if
they still think, that the claims of this kingdom are
reconcileable to the principles of true liberty and
legitimate government, I am afraid, that nothing I
shall farther say will have any effect on their judgments.
I wish, however, they would have the patience
and candour to go with me, and grant me a
hearing some time longer.</p>

<p>Though clearly decided in my own judgment
on this subject, I am inclined to make great allowances
for the different judgments of others. We
have been so used to speak of the Colonies as <i>our</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_32" id="Page_1_32">[32]</a></span>
Colonies, and to think of them as in a state of subordination
to us, and as holding their existence in
<i>America</i> only for our use, that it is no wonder the
prejudices of many are alarmed, when they find a
different doctrine maintained. The meanest person
among us is disposed to look upon himself as
having a body of subjects in <i>America</i>; and to be
offended at the denial of his right to make laws
for them, though perhaps he does not know what
colour they are of, or what language they talk.—Such
are the natural prejudices of this country.—But
the time is coming, I hope, when the
unreasonableness of them will be seen; and more
just sentiments prevail.</p>

<p class="tb">Before I proceed, I beg it may be attended to,
that I have chosen to try this question by the general
principles of Civil Liberty; and not by the
practice of former times; or by the <i>Charters</i> granted
the colonies.—The arguments <i>for</i> them,
drawn from these last topics, appear to me greatly
to outweigh the arguments <i>against</i> them. But I
wish to have this question brought to a higher test,
and surer issue. The question with all liberal enquirers
ought to be, not what jurisdiction over
them <i>Precedents</i>, <i>Statutes</i>, and <i>Charters</i> give, but
what reason and equity, and the rights of humanity
give.—This is, in truth, a question which no
kingdom has ever before had occasion to agitate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_33" id="Page_1_33">[33]</a></span>
The case of a free country branching itself out in
the manner <i>Britain</i> has done, and sending to a
distant world colonies which have there, from
small beginnings, and under free legislatures of their
own, increased, and formed a body of powerful
states, likely soon to become superior the parent
state.—This is a case which is new in the history
of mankind; and it is extremely improper to judge
of it by the rules of any narrow and partial policy;
or to consider it on any other ground than the
general one of reason and justice.—Those who
will be candid enough to judge on this ground, and
who can divest themselves of national prejudices,
will not, I fancy, remain long unsatisfied.—But
alas! Matters are gone too far. The dispute probably
must be settled another way; and the sword
alone, I am afraid, is now to determine what the
rights of <i>Britain</i> and <i>America</i> are.—Shocking
situation!—Detested be the measures which have
brought us into it: And, if we are endeavouring
to enforce injustice, cursed will be the war.—A
retreat, however, is not yet impracticable. The
duty we owe our gracious sovereign obliges us to
rely on his disposition to stay the sword, and to
promote the happiness of all the different parts
of the Empire at the head of which he is placed.
With some hopes, therefore, that it may not be
too late to reason on this subject, I will, in the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_34" id="Page_1_34">[34]</a></span>
Sections, enquire what the war with <i>America</i>
is in the following respects.</p>

<p>1. In respect of Justice.</p>

<p>2. The Principles of the Constitution.</p>

<p>3. In respect of Policy and Humanity.</p>

<p>4. The Honour of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>And lastly, The Probability of succeeding in it.</p>

<h3 id="I_PART_II_SECT_I">SECT. I.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Justice of the War with America.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The enquiry, whether the war with the Colonies
is a <i>just</i> war, will be best determined
by stating the power over them, which it is the
end of the war to maintain: And this cannot be
better done, than in the words of an act of parliament,
made on purpose to define it. That act,
it is well known, declares, “That this kingdom has
power, and of right ought to have power to
make laws and statutes to bind the Colonies,
and people of <i>America</i>, in all cases whatever.”—Dreadful
power indeed! I defy any one to
express slavery in stronger language. It is the
same with declaring “that we have a right to do
with them what we please.”—I will not waste my
time by applying to such a claim any of the preceding
arguments. If my reader does not feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_35" id="Page_1_35">[35]</a></span>
more in this case, than words can express, all reasoning
must be vain.</p>

<p>But, probably, most persons will be for using
milder language; and for saying no more than,
that the united legislatures of <i>England</i> and <i>Scotland</i>
have of right power to tax the Colonies, and
a <i>supremacy</i> of legislation over <i>America</i>.—But
this comes to the same. If it means any thing, it
means, that the property and the legislations of
the Colonies, are subject to the absolute discretion
of <i>Great Britain</i>, and ought of right to be so. The
nature of the thing admits of no limitation. The
Colonies can never be admitted to be judges, how
far the authority over them in these cases shall extend.
This would be to destroy it entirely—If
<i>any</i> part of their property is subject to our discretion,
the <i>whole</i> must be so. If we have a right
to interfere at all in their internal legislations, we
have a right to interfere as far as we think proper.—It
is self-evident, that this leaves them nothing
they can call <i>their own</i>.—And what is it that
can give to any people such a supremacy over
another people?—I have already examined
the principal answers which have been given to
this enquiry. But it will not be amiss in this place
to go over some of them again.</p>

<p class="tb">It has been urged, that such a right must be
lodged somewhere, “in order to preserve the
<span class="smcap">Unity</span> of the British Empire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_36" id="Page_1_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Pleas of this sort have, in all ages, been used to
justify tyranny.—They have in <span class="smcap">Religion</span>
given rise to numberless oppressive claims, and
slavish Hierarchies. And in the <i>Romish Communion</i>
particularly, it is well known, that the <span class="smcap">Pope</span>
claims the title and powers of the supreme head
on earth of the Christian church, in order to preserve
its <span class="smcap">Unity</span>.—With respect to the <i>British
Empire</i>, nothing can be more preposterous than to
endeavour to maintain its unity, by setting up such
a claim. This is a method of establishing unity,
which, like the similar method in religion, can
produce nothing but discord and mischief.—The
truth is, that a common relation to one supreme
executive head; an exchange of kind offices;
tyes of interest and affection, and <i>compacts</i>,
are sufficient to give the British Empire all the
unity that is necessary. But if not—If, in order
to preserve its <i>Unity</i>, one half of it must be enslaved
to the other half, let it, in the name of
God, want Unity.</p>

<p>Much has been said of “the <i>Superiority</i> of the
British State.” But what gives us our superiority?—Is
it our <i>Wealth</i>?—This never confers real
dignity. On the contrary: Its effect is always to
debase, intoxicate, and corrupt.—Is it the <i>number
of our people</i>? The colonies will soon be equal to
us in number.—Is it our <i>Knowledge</i> and <i>Virtue</i>?
They are probably <i>equally</i> knowing, and <i>more</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_37" id="Page_1_37">[37]</a></span>
virtuous. There are names among them that will
not stoop to any names among the philosophers
and politicians of this island.</p>

<p>“But we are the <span class="smcap">Parent State</span>.”—These are
the magic words which have fascinated and misled
us.—The English came from <i>Germany</i>. Does
that give the <i>German</i> states a right to tax us?—Children,
having no property, and being incapable
of guiding themselves, the author of nature
has committed the care of them to their parents,
and subjected them to their absolute authority.
But there is a period when, having acquired property,
and a capacity of judging for themselves,
they become independent agents; and when, for
this reason, the authority of their parents ceases,
and becomes nothing but the respect and influence
due to benefactors. Supposing, therefore, that the
order of nature in establishing the relation between
parents and children, ought to have been the rule
of our conduct to the Colonies, we should have
been gradually relaxing our authority as they grew
up. But, like mad parents, we have done the contrary;
and, at the very time when our authority
should have been most relaxed, we have carried it
to the greatest extent, and exercised it with the
greatest rigour. No wonder then, that they have
turned upon us; and obliged us to remember,
that they are not Children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_38" id="Page_1_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“But we have, it is said, protected them, and
run deeply in debt on their account.”—The full
answer to this has been already given, (<a href="#Page_1_26">page 26</a>.)
Will any one say, that all we have done for them
has not been more on our <i>own</i> account,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> than
on <i>theirs</i>?—But suppose the contrary. Have
they done nothing for us? Have they made no
compensation for the protection they have received?
Have they not helped us to pay our <i>taxes</i>, to
support our poor, and to bear the burthen of our
debts, by taking from us, at our own price, all the
commodities with which we can supply them?—Have
they not, for our advantage, submitted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_39" id="Page_1_39">[39]</a></span>
many restraints in acquiring property? Must they
likewise resign to us the disposal of that property?—Has
not their exclusive trade with us been
for many years one of the chief sources of our
wealth and power?—In all our wars have they not
fought by our side, and contributed much to our
success? In the last war, particularly, it is well
known, that they ran themselves deeply in debt;
and that the parliament thought it necessary to
grant them considerable sums annually as compensations
for going beyond their abilities in assisting
us. And in this course would they have continued
for many future years; perhaps, for ever.—In
short; were an accurate account stated, it is by no
means certain which side would appear to be most
indebted. When asked as <i>freemen</i>, they have
hitherto seldom discovered any reluctance in giving.
But, in obedience to a demand, and with the bayonet
at their breasts, they will give us nothing but
blood.</p>

<p>It is farther said, “that the land on which they
settled was ours.”—But how came it to be ours?
If sailing along a coast can give a right to a country,
then might the people of <i>Japan</i> become, as
soon as they please, the proprietors of <i>Britain</i>.
Nothing can be more chimerical than property
founded on such a reason. If the land on which
the Colonies first settled had any proprietors, they
were the natives. The greatest part of it they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_40" id="Page_1_40">[40]</a></span>
bought of the natives. They have since cleared
and cultivated it; and, without any help from us,
converted a wilderness into fruitful and pleasant
fields. It is, therefore, now on a double account
their property; and no power on earth can have
any right to disturb them in the possession of it, or
to take from them, without their consent, any part
of its produce.</p>

<p>But let it be granted, that the land was ours.
Did they not settle upon it under the faith of charters,
which promised them the enjoyment of all
the rights of <i>Englishmen</i>; and allowed them to tax
themselves, and to be governed by legislatures of
their own, similar to ours? These charters were
given them by an authority, which at the time was
thought competent; and they have been rendered
sacred by an acquiescence on our part for near
a century. Can it then be wondered at, that
the Colonies should revolt, when they found their
charters violated; and an attempt made to force
<span class="smcapuc">INNOVATIONS</span> upon them by famine and the sword;—But
I lay no stress on charters. They derive
their rights from a higher source. It is inconsistent
with common sense to imagine, that any people
would ever think of settling in a distant country,
on any such condition, as that the people from
whom they withdrew, should for ever be masters of
their property, and have power to subject them to
any modes of government they pleased. And had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_41" id="Page_1_41">[41]</a></span>
there been express stipulations to this purpose in all
the charters of the colonies, they would, in my
opinion, be no more bound by them, than if it
had been stipulated with them, that they should go
naked, or expose themselves to the incursions of
wolves and tigers.</p>

<p>The defective state of the representation of this
kingdom has been farther pleaded to prove our
right to tax <i>America</i>. We submit to a parliament
that does not represent us, and therefore they
ought.—How strange an argument is this? It
is saying we want liberty; and therefore, they
ought to want it.—Suppose it true, that they
are indeed contending for a better constitution of
government, and more liberty than we enjoy:
Ought this to make us angry?—Who is there
that does not see the danger to which this country
is exposed?—Is it generous, because we are in
a sink, to endeavour to draw them into it? Ought
we not rather to wish earnestly, that there may at
least be <span class="smcapuc">ONE FREE COUNTRY</span> left upon earth, to
which we may fly, when venality, luxury, and vice
have completed the ruin of liberty here?</p>

<p>It is, however, by no means true, that <i>America</i>
has no more right to be exempted from taxation
by the <i>British</i> parliament, than <i>Britain</i> itself.—<i>Here</i>,
all freeholders, and burgesses in boroughs,
are represented. <i>There</i>, not one <i>Freeholder</i>, or any
other person, is represented.—<i>Here</i>, the <i>aids</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_42" id="Page_1_42">[42]</a></span>
granted by the represented part of the kingdom
must be proportionably <i>paid</i> by themselves; and
the laws they make for <i>others</i>, they at the same
time make for <i>themselves</i>. <i>There</i>, the aids they
would grant would not be <i>paid</i>, but <i>received</i>, by
themselves; and the laws they made would be
made for <i>others only</i>.—In short. The relation of one
country to another country, whose representatives
have the power of taxing it (and of appropriating
the money raised by the taxes) is much the same
with the relation of a country to a single despot, or
a body of despots, within itself, invested with the
like power. In both cases, the people taxed and
those who tax have separate interests; nor can there
be any thing to check oppression, besides either the
abilities of the people taxed, or the humanity of
the <i>taxers</i>.—But indeed I can never hope to convince
that person of any thing, who does not see an
essential difference<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> between the two cases now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_43" id="Page_1_43">[43]</a></span>
mentioned; or between the circumstances of individuals,
and classes of men, making parts of a community
imperfectly represented in the legislature
that governs it; and the circumstances of a whole
community, in a distant world, not at all represented.</p>

<p>But enough has been said by others on this point;
nor is it possible for me to throw any new light
upon it. To finish, therefore, what I meant to
offer under this head, I must beg that the following
considerations may be particularly attended to.</p>

<p class="tb">The question now between us and the Colonies
is, Whether, in respect of taxation and internal
legislation, they are bound to be subject to the
jurisdiction of this kingdom: Or, in other words,
Whether the <i>British</i> parliament has or has not of
right, a power to dispose of their property, and to
model as it pleases their governments?—To
this supremacy over them, we say, we are entitled;
and in order to maintain it, we have begun the
present war.—Let me here enquire,</p>

<p><i>1st.</i> Whether, if we have now this supremacy,
we shall not be equally entitled to it in any future
time?—They are now but little short of half
our number. To this number they have grown,
from a small body of original settlers, by a very
rapid increase. The probability is, that they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_44" id="Page_1_44">[44]</a></span>
go on to increase; and that, in 50 or 60 years, they
will be <i>double</i> our number;<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and form a mighty
Empire, consisting of a variety of states, all equal
or superior to ourselves in all the arts and accomplishments,
which give dignity and happiness to
human life. In that period, will they be still
bound to acknowledge that supremacy over them
which we now claim? Can there be any person
who will assert this; or whose mind does not revolt
at the idea of a vast continent, holding all
that is valuable to it, at the discretion of a handful
of people on the other side the <i>Atlantic</i>?—But
if, at <i>that</i> period, this would be unreasonable;
what makes it otherwise <i>now</i>?—Draw the line,
if you can.—But there is a still greater difficulty.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Britain</i> is now, I will suppose, the seat of Liberty
and Virtue; and its legislature consists of a body
of able and independent men, who govern with
wisdom and justice. The time may come when all
will be reversed: When its excellent constitution
of government will be subverted: When, pressed
by debts and taxes, it will be greedy to draw to
itself an increase of revenue from every distant
Province, in order to ease its own burdens: When
the influence of the crown, strengthened by luxury
and an universal profligacy of manners, will have
tainted every heart, broken down every fence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_45" id="Page_1_45">[45]</a></span>
of Liberty, and rendered us a nation of tame and
contented vassals: When a General <i>Election</i> will be
nothing but a general <i>Auction</i> of <i>Boroughs</i>: And
when the <span class="smcap">Parliament</span>, the Grand Council of the
nation, and once the faithful guardian of the state,
and a terror to evil ministers, will be degenerated
into a body of <i>Sycophants</i>, dependent and venal,
always ready to confirm <i>any</i> measures; and little
more than a public court for registering royal
edicts.—Such, it is possible, may, some time or
other, be the state of <i>Great Britain</i>.—What
will, at that period, be the duty of the Colonies?
Will they be still bound to unconditional submission?
Must they always continue an appendage
to our government; and follow it implicitly
through every change that can happen to it?—Wretched
condition, indeed, of millions of freemen
as good as ourselves.—Will you say that
we now govern equitably; and that there is no
danger of any such revolution?—Would to God
this were true.—But will you not always say the
same? Who shall judge whether we govern equitably
or not? Can you give the Colonies any <i>security</i>
that such a period will never come? Once more.</p>

<p class="tb">If we have indeed that power which we claim
over the legislations, and internal rights of the
Colonies, may we not, whenever we please, subject
them to the arbitrary power of the crown?—I
do not mean, that this would be a disadvantageous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_46" id="Page_1_46">[46]</a></span>
change: For I have before observed,
that if a people are to be subject to an external
power over which they have no command, it is
better that power should be lodged in the hands of
one man than of a multitude. But many persons
think otherwise; and such ought to consider that,
if this would be a calamity, the condition of the
Colonies must be deplorable.—“A government
by King, Lords, and Commons, (it has
been said) is the perfection of government;” and
so it is, when the Commons are a just representation
of the people; and when also, it is not
extended to any distant people, or communities,
not represented. But if this is the <i>best</i>, a government
by a king only must be the <i>worst</i>; and
every claim implying a right to establish such
a government among any people must be unjust
and cruel.—It is self-evident, that by claiming
a right to alter the constitutions of the Colonies,
according to our discretion, we claim this power:
And it is a power that we have thought fit to exercise
in <i>one</i> of our Colonies; and that we have attempted
to exercise in <i>another</i>.—<i>Canada</i>, according
to the late extension of its limits, is a
country almost as large as half <i>Europe</i>; and it may
possibly come in time to be filled with British subjects.
The <i>Quebec</i> act makes the king of <i>Great
Britain</i> a despot over all that country.—In the
Province of <i>Massachuset’s Bay</i> the same thing has
been attempted and begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_47" id="Page_1_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The act for <span class="smcapuc">BETTER</span> <i>regulating their government</i>,
passed at the same time with the <i>Quebec</i> act, gives
the king the right of appointing, and removing at
his pleasure, the members of one part of the legislature;
alters the mode of chusing juries, on purpose
to bring it more under the influence of the king;
and takes away from the province the power of
calling any meetings of the people without the
king’s consent.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>—The judges, likewise, have
been made dependent on the king, for their nomination
and pay, and continuance in office.—If all
this is no more than we have a right to do; may
we not go on to abolish the house of representatives,
to destroy all trials by juries, and to give up
the province absolutely and totally to the will of
the king?—May we not even establish popery
in the province, as has been lately done in <i>Canada</i>,
leaving the support of protestantism to the king’s
discretion?—Can there be any Englishman who,
were it his own case, would not sooner lose his
heart’s blood than yield to claims so pregnant with
evils, and destructive to every thing that can distinguish
a <i>Freeman</i> from a <i>Slave</i>?</p>

<p>I will take this opportunity to add, that what I
have now said, suggests a consideration that demonstrates,
on how different a footing the Colonies
are with respect to our government, from particular
bodies of men <i>within</i> the kingdom, who happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_48" id="Page_1_48">[48]</a></span>
not to be represented. Here, it is impossible
that the represented part should subject the unrepresented
part to arbitrary power, without including
themselves. But in the Colonies it is <i>not</i>
impossible. We know that it <i>has</i> been done.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Whether the War with <span class="antiqua">America</span> is justified by
the Principles of the Constitution.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">I have proposed, in the next place, to examine
the war with the Colonies by the principles of
the constitution.—I know, that it is common to
say that we are now maintaining the constitution in
<i>America</i>. If this means that we are endeavouring
to establish our own constitution of government
there; it is by no means true; nor, were it true,
would it be right. They have chartered governments
of their own, with which they are pleased;
and which, if any power on earth may change
without their consent, that power may likewise, if
it thinks proper, deliver them over to the <i>Grand
Seignior</i>.—Suppose the Colonies of <i>France</i> had,
by compacts, enjoyed for many years, free governments
open to all the world, under which they had
grown and flourished; what should we think of
that kingdom, were it to attempt to destroy their
governments, and to force upon them its own
mode of government? Should we not applaud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_49" id="Page_1_49">[49]</a></span>
any zeal they discovered in repelling such an injury?—But
the truth is, in the present instance,
that we are not maintaining but violating
our own constitution in <i>America</i>. The essence of
our constitution consists in its independency.
There is in this case no difference between <i>subjection</i>
and <i>annihilation</i>. Did, therefore, the Colonies
possess governments perfectly the same with ours,
the attempt to subject them to ours would be an
attempt to ruin them. A free government loses
its nature from the moment it becomes liable to be
commanded or altered by any superior power.</p>

<p>But I intended here principally to make the following
observation.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle of our government
is, “The right of a people to give and grant their
own money.”—It is of no consequence, in
this case, whether we enjoy this right in a proper
manner or not. Most certainly we do not. It is,
however, the <i>principle</i> on which our government,
as a <i>free</i> government, is founded. The <i>spirit</i> of
the constitution gives it us; and, however imperfectly
enjoyed, we glory in it as our first and
greatest blessing. It was an attempt to encroach
upon this right, in a trifling instance, that produced
the civil war in the reign of <i>Charles</i> the First.—Ought
not our brethren in <i>America</i> to enjoy this
right as well as ourselves? Do the principles of
the constitution give it <i>us</i>, but deny it to <i>them</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_50" id="Page_1_50">[50]</a></span>
Or can we, with any decency, pretend that when
we give to the king <i>their</i> money, we give him <i>our
own</i>?<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>—What difference does it make, that
in the time of <i>Charles the First</i> the attempt to take
away this right was made by <i>one man</i>: but that, in
the case of <i>America</i>, it is made by a body of men?</p>

<p>In a word. This is a war undertaken not only
against the principles of our own constitution; but
on purpose to destroy other similar constitutions in
<i>America</i>; and to substitute in their room a military
force. See <a href="#Page_1_23">page 23, 24</a>.—It is, therefore, a
gross and flagrant violation of the constitution.</p>

<h3 id="I_PART_II_SECT_III">SECT. III.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Policy if the War with <span class="antiqua">America</span>.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">In writing the present Section, I enter upon
a subject of the last importance, on which
much has been said by other writers with great
force, and in the ablest manner<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. But I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_51" id="Page_1_51">[51]</a></span>
willing to omit any topic which I think of great
consequence, merely because it has already been
discussed: And, with respect to this in particular,
it will, I believe, be found that some of the observations
on which I shall insist, have not been sufficiently
attended to.</p>

<p class="tb">The object of this war has been often enough
declared to be “maintaining the supremacy of this
country over the colonies.” I have already enquired
how far reason and justice, the principles of
Liberty, and the rights of humanity, entitle us to
this supremacy. Setting aside, therefore, now
all considerations of this kind, I would observe,
that this supremacy is to be maintained, either
merely <i>for its own sake</i>, or for the sake of some
public interest connected with it and dependent
upon it.—If <i>for its own sake</i>; the only object
of the war is the extension of dominion; and its
only motive is the lust of power.—All government,
even <i>within</i> a state, becomes tyrannical,
as far as it is a needless and wanton exercise
of power; or is carried farther than is absolutely
necessary to preserve the peace and to secure
the safety of the state. This is what an excellent
writer calls <span class="smcapuc">GOVERNING TOO MUCH</span>;
and its effect must always be, weakening government
by rendering it contemptible and odious.—Nothing
can be of more importance, in governing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_52" id="Page_1_52">[52]</a></span>
distant provinces and adjusting the clashing
interests of different societies, than attention to
this remark. In these circumstances it is <i>particularly</i>
necessary to make a sparing use of power, in
order to preserve power.—Happy would it have
been for <i>Great Britain</i>, had this been remembered
by those who have lately conducted its affairs.
But our policy has been of another kind. At the
period when our authority should have been most
concealed, it has been brought most in view;
and by a progression of violent measures, every
one of which has increased distress, we have given
the world reason to conclude, that we are acquainted
with no other method of governing than <i>by
force</i>.—What a shocking mistake!—If our object
is power, we should have known better how to use
it; and our rulers should have considered, that
freemen will always revolt at the sight of a naked
sword; and that the complicated affairs of a great
kingdom, holding in subordination to it a multitude
of distant communities, all jealous of their
rights, and warmed with spirits as high as our own,
require not only the most skilful, but the most cautious
and tender management. The consequences
of a different management we are now feeling.
We see ourselves driven among rocks, and in danger
of being lost.</p>

<p class="tb">The following reasons make it too probable,
that the present contest with <i>America</i> is a contest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_53" id="Page_1_53">[53]</a></span>
for power only<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, abstracted from all the advantages
connected with it.</p>

<p><i>1st.</i> There is a love of power inherent in
human nature; and it cannot be uncharitable
to suppose that the nation in general, and
the cabinet in particular, are too likely to be influenced
by it. What can be more flattering than to
look across the <i>Atlantic</i>, and to see in the boundless
continent of <i>America</i>, increasing <span class="smcap">Millions</span>
whom we have a right to order as we please, who
hold their property at our disposal, and who have
no other law than our will. With what complacency
have we been used to talk of them as <span class="smcapuc">OUR</span>
subjects?—Is it not the interruption they now
give to this pleasure; is it not the opposition they
make to our pride; and not any injury they have
done us, that is the secret spring of our present animosity
against them?—I wish all in this kingdom
would examine themselves carefully on this
point. Perhaps, they might find, that they have
not known what spirit they are of.—Perhaps, they
would become sensible, that it was a spirit of domination,
more than a regard to the true interest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_54" id="Page_1_54">[54]</a></span>
this country, that lately led so many of them, with
such savage folly, to address the throne for the
slaughter of their brethren in <i>America</i>, if they will
not submit to them; and to make offers of their
lives and fortunes for that purpose.—Indeed, I
am persuaded, that, were pride and the lust of dominion
exterminated from every heart among us,
and the humility of Christians infused in their
room, this quarrel would be soon ended.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>2dly.</i> Another reason for believing that this is a
contest for power only is, that our ministers have
frequently declared, that their object is not to draw
a revenue from <i>America</i>; and that many of those
who are warmest for continuing it, represent the
<i>American trade</i> as of no great consequence.</p>

<p>But what deserves particular consideration here
is, that this is a contest from which no advantages
can possibly be derived.—Not a revenue:
For the provinces of America, when desolated,
will afford no revenue; or if they should, the expence
of subduing them and keeping them in subjection
will much exceed that revenue.—Not
any of the advantages of trade: For it is a folly,
next to insanity, to think trade can be promoted
by impoverishing our customers, and fixing in
their minds an everlasting abhorrence of us.—It
remains, therefore, that this war can have no
other object than the extension of power.—Miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_55" id="Page_1_55">[55]</a></span>
reflection!—To sheath our swords in the
bowels of our brethren, and spread misery and
ruin among a happy people, for no other end
than to oblige them to acknowledge our supremacy.
How horrid!—This is the cursed ambition
that led a <i>Cæsar</i> and an <i>Alexander</i>, and many other
mad conquerors, to attack peaceful communities,
and to lay waste the earth.</p>

<p>But a worse principle than even this, influences
some among us. Pride and the love of dominion
are principles hateful enough; but blind resentment
and the desire of revenge are infernal principles:
And these, I am afraid, have no small share
at present in guiding our public conduct.—One
cannot help indeed being astonished at the
virulence, with which some speak on the present
occasion against the Colonies.—For, what have
they done?—Have they crossed the ocean and
invaded us? Have they attempted to take from
us the fruits of our labour, and to overturn that
form of government which we hold so sacred?—This
cannot be pretended.—On the contrary.
This is what we have done to them.—We have
transported ourselves to their peaceful retreats,
and employed our fleets and armies to stop up
their ports, to destroy their commerce, to seize
their effects, and to burn their towns. Would we
but let them alone, and suffer them to enjoy in
security their property and governments, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_56" id="Page_1_56">[56]</a></span>
of disturbing us, they would thank and bless us.
And yet it is <span class="smcap">We</span> who imagine ourselves ill-used.—The
truth is, we expected to find them
a cowardly rabble who would lie quietly at our
feet; and they have disappointed us. They have
risen in their own defence, and repelled force by
force. They deny the plenitude of our power
over them; and insist upon being treated as free
communities.—It is <span class="smcapuc">THIS</span> that has provoked
us; and kindled our governors into rage.</p>

<p>I hope I shall not here be understood to intimate,
that <i>all</i> who promote this war are actuated
by these principles. Some, I doubt not, are influenced
by no other principle, than a regard to
what they think the just authority of this country
over its colonies, and to the unity and indivisibility
of the British Empire. I wish such could be
engaged to enter thoroughly into the enquiry,
which has been the subject of the first part of this
pamphlet; and to consider, particularly, how different
a thing maintaining the authority of government
<i>within</i> a state is from maintaining the authority
of one people over another, already happy in
the enjoyment of a government of their own. I
wish farther they would consider, that the desire of
maintaining authority is warrantable, only as far as
it is the means of promoting some end, and doing
some good; and that, before we resolve to spread
famine and fire through a country in order to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_57" id="Page_1_57">[57]</a></span>
it acknowledge our authority, we ought to be assured
that great advantages will arise not only to
ourselves, but to the country we wish to conquer.—That
from the present contest no advantage
to <i>ourselves</i> can arise, has been already shewn, and
will presently be shewn more at large.—That no
advantage to the Colonies can arise from it, need
not, I hope, be shewn. It has however been asserted,
that even <i>their</i> good is intended by this
war. Many of us are persuaded, that they will be
much happier under our government, than under
any government of their own; and that their liberties
will be safer when held for them by us,
than when trusted in their own hands.—How
kind is it thus to take upon us the trouble of
judging for them what is most for their happiness?
Nothing can be kinder except the resolution we
have formed to exterminate them, if they will not
submit to our judgment.—What strange language
have I sometimes heard? By an armed
force we are now endeavouring to destroy the laws
and governments of America; and yet I have
heard it said, that we are endeavouring to support
law and government there. We are insisting upon
our right to levy contributions upon them; and
to maintain this right, we are bringing upon them
all the miseries a people can endure; and yet it is
asserted, that we mean nothing but their security
and happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_58" id="Page_1_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>But I have wandered a little from the point I attended
principally to insist upon in this section,
which is, “the folly, in respect of policy, of the
measures which have brought on this contest;
and its pernicious and fatal tendency.”</p>

<p>The following observations will, I believe,
abundantly prove this.</p>

<p><i>1st.</i> There are points which are likely always to
suffer by discussion. Of this kind are most points
of authority and prerogative; and the best policy is
to avoid, as much as possible, giving any occasion
for calling them into question.</p>

<p>The colonies were at the beginning of this reign
in the habit of acknowledging our authority, and
of allowing us as much power over them as our
interest required; and more, in some instances,
than we could reasonably claim. This habit they
would have retained: and had we, instead of imposing
new burdens upon them, and increasing
their restraints, studied to promote their commerce,
and to grant them new indulgences, they
would have been always growing more attached to
us. Luxury, and, together with it, their dependence
upon us, and our influence<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in their assemblies,
would have increased, till in time perhaps
they would have become as corrupt as ourselves;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_59" id="Page_1_59">[59]</a></span>
and we might have succeeded to our wishes
in establishing our authority over them.—But,
happily for <i>them</i>, we have chosen a different course.
By exertions of authority which have alarmed them,
they have been put upon examining into the
grounds of all our claims, and forced to give up
their luxuries, and to seek all their resources within
themselves: And the issue is likely to prove
the loss of <i>all</i> our authority over them, and of all
the advantages connected with it. So little do
men in power sometimes know how to preserve
power; and so remarkably does the desire of extending
dominion sometimes destroy it.—Mankind
are naturally disposed to continue in subjection
to that mode of government, be it what it
will, under which they have been born and educated.
Nothing rouses them into resistance but gross
abuses, or some particular oppressions out of the
road to which they have been used. And he who
will examine the history of the world will find,
there has generally been more reason for complaining
that they have been too patient, than that they
have been turbulent and rebellious.</p>

<p>Our governors, ever since I can remember, have
been jealous that the Colonies, some time or other,
would throw off their dependence. This jealously
was not founded on any of their acts or declarations.
They have always, while at <i>peace</i> with
us, disclaimed any such design; and they have
continued to disclaim it since they have been at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_60" id="Page_1_60">[60]</a></span>
<i>war</i> with us. I have reason, indeed, to believe,
that independency is, even at this moment,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> generally
dreaded among them as a calamity to which
they are in danger of being driven, in order to
avoid a greater.—The jealousy I have mentioned,
was, however, natural; and betrayed a secret
opinion, that the subjection in which they were
held was more than we could expect them always
to endure. In such circumstances, all possible
care should have been taken to give them no reason
for discontent, and to preserve them in subjection,
by keeping in that line of conduct to which
custom had reconciled them, or at least never deviating
from it, except with great caution; and
particularly, by avoiding all direct attacks on their
property and legislations. Had we done this, the
different interests of so many states scattered over a
vast continent, joined to our own prudence and
moderation, would have enabled us to maintain
them in dependence for ages to come.—But instead
of this, how have we acted?—It is in
truth too evident, that our whole conduct, instead
of being directed by that sound policy and foresight
which in such circumstances were absolutely
necessary, has been nothing (to say the best of it)
but a series of the blindest rigour followed by retractation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_61" id="Page_1_61">[61]</a></span>
of violence followed by concession;
of mistake, weakness and inconsistency.—A recital
of a few facts, within every body’s recollection,
will fully prove this.</p>

<p>In the 6th of <i>George the Second</i>, an act was
passed for imposing certain duties on all foreign
spirits, molasses and sugars imported into the plantations.
In this act, the duties imposed are said to
be <span class="smcapuc">GIVEN</span> and <span class="smcapuc">GRANTED</span> by the Parliament to the
King; and this is the first <i>American</i> act in which
these words have been used. But notwithstanding
this, as the act had the appearance of being only
a regulation of trade, the colonies submitted to
it; and a small direct revenue was drawn by it
from them.—In the 4th of the present reign,
many alterations were made in this act, with
the declared purpose of making provision for
raising a revenue in America. This alarmed the
Colonies; and produced discontents and remonstrances,
which might have convinced our rulers
this was tender ground, on which it became them
to tread very gently.—There is, however, no
reason to doubt but in time they would have
sunk into a quiet submission to this revenue act,
as being at worst only the exercise of a power
which then they seem not to have thought much
of contesting; I mean, the power of taxing them
<span class="smcapuc">EXTERNALLY</span>.—But before they had time to
cool, a worse provocation was given them; and
the <span class="smcap">Stamp-Act</span> was passed. This being an attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_62" id="Page_1_62">[62]</a></span>
to tax them <span class="smcapuc">INTERNALLY</span>; and a direct attack
on their property, by a power which would
not suffer itself to be questioned; which eased <i>itself</i>
by loading <i>them</i>; and to which it was impossible
to fix any bounds; they were thrown at
once, from one end of the continent to the other,
into resistance and rage.—Government, dreading
the consequences, gave way; and the Parliament
(upon a change of ministry) repealed
the <i>Stamp-Act</i>, without requiring from them
any recognition of its authority, or doing any
more to preserve its dignity, than asserting, by
the declaratory law, that it was possessed of full
power and authority to make laws to bind them
in all cases whatever.—Upon this, peace was
restored; and, had no farther attempts of the
same kind been made, they would undoubtedly
have suffered us (as the people of <i>Ireland</i>
have done) to enjoy quietly our declaratory law.
They would have recovered their former habits
of subjection; and our connexion with them might
have continued an increasing source of our wealth
and glory.—But the spirit of despotism and
avarice, always blind and restless, soon broke
forth again. The scheme for drawing a revenue
from <i>America</i>, by parliamentary taxation, was
resumed; and in a little more than a year after
the repeal of the <i>Stamp-Act</i>, when all was peace,
a third act was passed, imposing duties payable in
<i>America</i> on tea, paper, glass, painters colours, &amp;c.— This,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_63" id="Page_1_63">[63]</a></span>
as might have been expected, revived
all the former heats; and the Empire was a second
time threatened with the most dangerous commotions.—Government
receded again; and the
Parliament (under another change of ministry)
repealed all the obnoxious duties, <span class="smcapuc">EXCEPT</span> that
upon tea. This exception was made in order
to maintain a shew of dignity. But it was, in
reality, sacrificing safety to pride; and leaving
a splinter in the wound to produce a gangrene.—For
some time, however, this relaxation answered
its intended purposes. Our commercial
intercourse with the Colonies was again recovered;
and they avoided nothing but that tea
which we had excepted in our repeal. In this
state would things have remained, and even tea
would perhaps in time have been gradually admitted,
had not the evil genius of <i>Britain</i> stepped
forth once more to embroil the Empire.</p>

<p>The <i>East India</i> company having fallen under
difficulties, partly in consequence of the loss of the
<i>American</i> market for tea, a scheme was formed for
assisting them by an attempt to recover that market.
With this view an act was passed to
enable them to export their tea to <i>America</i> free
of all duties here, and subject only to 3d.
per pound duty, payable in <i>America</i>. It was
to be offered at a low price; and it was expected
the consequence would prove that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_64" id="Page_1_64">[64]</a></span>
Colonies would be tempted to buy it; a precedent
gained for taxing them; and at the same time the
company relieved. Ships were, therefore, fitted
out; and large cargoes sent. The snare was too
gross to escape the notice of the Colonies. They
saw it, and spurned at it. They refused to admit
the tea; and at <span class="smcap">Boston</span> some persons in disguise
threw it into the sea.—Had our governors in this
case satisfied themselves with requiring a compensation
from the province for the damage done, there is
no doubt but it would have been granted. Or
had they proceeded no farther in the infliction of
punishment, than stopping up the port and destroying
the trade of Boston, till compensation was
made, the province might possibly have submitted,
and a sufficient saving would have been gained
for the honour of the nation. But having hitherto
proceeded without wisdom, they observed
now no bounds in their resentment. To the Boston
port bill was added a bill which destroyed the
chartered government of the province; a bill
which withdrew from the jurisdiction of the province,
persons who in particular cases should commit
murder; and the <i>Quebec</i> bill. At the same
time a strong body of troops was stationed at <i>Boston</i>
to enforce obedience to these bills.</p>

<p class="tb">All who knew any thing of the temper of the
Colonies saw that the effect of this sudden accumulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_65" id="Page_1_65">[65]</a></span>
of vengeance, would probably be not
intimidating but exasperating them, and driving
them into a general revolt. But our minister had
different apprehensions. They believed that the
malecontents in the Colony of <i>Massachusett’s</i> were
a small party, headed by a few factious men;
that the majority of the people would take the
side of government, as soon as they saw a force
among them capable of supporting them; that, at
worst, the Colonies in general would never make
a common cause with this province; and that, the
issue would prove, in a few months, order, tranquility
and submission.—Every one of these apprehensions
was falsified by the events that followed.</p>

<p>When the bills I have mentioned came to be
carried into execution, the whole province was
thrown into confusion. The courts of justice
were shut up, and all government was dissolved.
The commander in chief found it necessary to fortify
himself in Boston; and the other Colonies
immediately resolved to make a common cause
with this Colony.</p>

<p>Disappointed by these consequences, our ministers
took fright. Once more they made an effort
to retreat; but indeed the most ungracious one
that can well be imagined. A proposal was sent
to the Colonies, called Conciliatory; and the substance
of which was, that if any of them would
raise such sums as should be demanded of them
by taxing themselves, the Parliament would forbear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_66" id="Page_1_66">[66]</a></span>
to tax them.—It will be scarcely believed,
hereafter, that such a proposal could be thought
conciliatory. It was only telling them; “If
you will tax yourselves <span class="smcapuc">BY OUR ORDER</span>, we will
save ourselves the trouble of taxing you.”—They
received the proposal as an insult; and rejected
it with disdain.</p>

<p>At the time this concession was transmitted to
<i>America</i>, open hostilities were not begun. In the
sword our ministers thought they had still a resource
which would immediately settle all disputes.
They considered the people of <i>New-England</i> as
nothing but a mob, who would be soon routed
and forced into obedience. It was even believed,
that a few thousands of our army might march
through all <i>America</i>, and make all quiet where-ever
they went. Under this conviction our ministers
did not dread urging the Province of <i>Massachusett’s
Bay</i> into rebellion, by ordering the army
to seize their stores, and to take up some of their
leading men.—The attempt was made.—The
people fled immediately to arms, and repelled
the attack.—A considerable part of the
flower of the British army has been destroyed.—Some
of our best Generals, and the bravest
of our troops, are now<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> disgracefully and miserably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_67" id="Page_1_67">[67]</a></span>
imprisoned at <i>Boston</i>.—A horrid civil war
is commenced;—And the Empire is distracted
and convulsed.</p>

<p>Can it be possible to think with patience of the
policy that has brought us into these circumstances?
Did ever Heaven punish the vices of
a people more severely by darkening their counsels?
How great would be our happiness could
we now recall former times, and return to the policy
of the last reigns?—But those times are gone.—I
will, however, beg leave for a few moments
to look back to them; and to compare the ground
we have left with that on which we find ourselves.
This must be done with deep regret; but it forms
a necessary part of my present design.</p>

<p class="tb">In those times our Colonies, foregoing every advantage
which they might derive from trading with
foreign nations, consented to send only to us whatever
it was for our interest to receive from them; and
to receive only from us whatever it was for our interest
to send to them. They gave up the power
of making sumptuary laws, and exposed themselves
to all the evils of an increasing and wasteful
luxury, because we were benefited by vending
among them the materials of it. The iron with
which providence had blessed their country, they
were required by laws, in which they acquiesced,
to transport hither, that our people might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_68" id="Page_1_68">[68]</a></span>
maintained by working it for them into nails,
ploughs, axes, &amp;c. And, in several instances,
even one Colony was not allowed to supply any
neighbouring Colonies with commodities, which
could be conveyed to them from hence.—But
they yielded much farther. They consented
that we should have the appointment of one
branch of their legislature. By recognizing as
their King, a King resident among us and under
our influence, they gave us a negative on all
their laws. By allowing an appeal to us in their
civil disputes, they gave us likewise the ultimate
determination of all civil causes among them.—In
short. They allowed us every power we
could desire, except that of taxing them, and interfering
in their internal legislations: And they
had admitted precedents which, even in these instances,
gave us no inconsiderable authority over
them. By purchasing our goods they paid our
taxes; and, by allowing us to regulate their trade
in any manner we thought most for our advantage,
they enriched our merchants, and helped
us to bear our growing burdens. They fought
our battles with us. They gloried in their relation
to us. All their gains centered among us;
and they always spoke of this country and looked
to it as their home.</p>

<p>Such <span class="smcapuc">WAS</span> the state of things.—What is it
now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_69" id="Page_1_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Not contented with a degree of power, sufficient
to satisfy any reasonable ambition, we have attempted
to extend it.—Not contented with drawing
from them a large revenue <i>indirectly</i>, we have endeavoured
to procure one <i>directly</i> by an authoritative
seizure; and, in order to gain a pepper-corn in this
way, have chosen to hazard millions, acquired by
the peaceable intercourse of trade.—Vile policy!
What a scourge is government so conducted?—Had
we never deserted our old ground: Had
we nourished and favoured <i>America</i>, with a view to
commerce, instead of considering it as a country
to be governed: Had we, like a liberal and wise
people, rejoiced to see a multitude of free states
branched forth from ourselves, all enjoying independent
legislatures similar to our own: Had we
aimed at binding them to us only by the tyes of
affection and interest; and contented ourselves with
a moderate power rendered durable by being lenient
and friendly, an umpire in their differences,
an aid to them in improving their own free governments,
and their common bulwark against the assaults
of foreign enemies: Had this, I say, been
our policy and temper; there is nothing so great
or happy that we might not have expected. With
their increase our strength would have increased.
A growing surplus in the revenue might have been
gained, which, invariably applied to the gradual
discharge of the national debt, would have delivered
us from the ruin with which it threatens us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_70" id="Page_1_70">[70]</a></span>
The Liberty of <i>America</i> might have preserved our
Liberty; and, under the direction of a patriot king
or wise minister, proved the means of restoring to
us our almost lost constitution. Perhaps, in time,
we might also have been brought to see the necessity
of carefully watching and restricting our paper-credit:
And thus we might have regained safety;
and, in union with our Colonies, have been more
than a match for every enemy, and risen to a situation
of honour and dignity never before known
amongst mankind.—But I am forgetting myself.—Our
Colonies are likely to be lost for
ever. Their love is turned into hatred; and
their respect for our government into resentment
and abhorrence.—We shall see more distinctly
what a calamity this is, and the observations I have
now made will be confirmed, by attending to the
following facts.</p>

<p class="tb">Our American Colonies, particularly the Northern
ones, have been for some time in the happiest
state of society; or, in that middle state of
civilization, between its first rude and its last refined
and corrupt state. Old countries consist, generally,
of three classes of people; a <span class="smcap">Gentry</span>; a
<span class="smcap">Yeomanry</span>; and a <span class="smcap">Peasantry</span>. The Colonies
consist only of a body of <span class="smcap">Yeomanry</span><a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_71" id="Page_1_71">[71]</a></span>
by agriculture, and all independent, and nearly upon
a level; in consequence of which, joined to a
boundless extent of country, the means of subsistence
are procured without difficulty, and the temptations
to wickedness are so inconsiderable, that
executions<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> are seldom known among them.
From hence arises an encouragement to population
so great, that in some of the Colonies
they double their own number in fifteen years;
in others, in eighteen years; and in all, taken one
with another, in twenty-five years.—Such an
increase was, I believe, never before known. It
demonstrates that they must live at their ease; and
be free from those cares, oppressions, and diseases
which depopulate and ravage luxurious states.</p>

<p class="tb">With the population of the Colonies has increased
their trade; but much faster, on account of the
gradual introduction of luxury among them.—In
1723 the exports to <i>Pensylvania</i> were 16,000l.—In
1742 they were 75,295l.—In 1757 they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_72" id="Page_1_72">[72]</a></span>
were increased to 268,426l. and in 1773 to half a
million.</p>

<p>The exports to all the Colonies in 1744 were
640,114l.—In 1758, they were increased to
1.832,948l. and in 1773, to three millions.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
And the probability is, that, had it not been for the
discontents among the Colonies since the year 1764,
our trade with them would have been this year
double to what it was in 1773; and that in a
few years more, it would not have been possible
for the whole kingdom, though consisting only of
manufacturers, to supply the American demand.</p>

<p>This trade, it should be considered, was not only
thus an increasing trade; but it was a trade in
which we had no rivals; a trade certain, constant,
and uninterrupted; and which, by the shipping
employed in it, and the naval stores supplied by it,
contributed greatly to the support of that navy
which is our chief national strength.—Viewed in
these lights it was an object unspeakably important.
But it will appear still more so if we view it in its
connexions and dependencies. It is well known,
that our trade with <i>Africa</i> and the <i>West-Indies</i> cannot
easily subsist without it. And, upon the
whole, it is undeniable, that it has been one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_73" id="Page_1_73">[73]</a></span>
main springs of our opulence and splendour; and
that we have, in a great measure, been indebted to
it for our ability to bear a debt so much heavier,
than that which, fifty years ago, the wisest men
thought would necessarily sink us.</p>

<p>This inestimable prize, and all the advantages
connected with <i>America</i>, we are now throwing
away. Experience alone can shew what calamities
must follow. It will indeed be astonishing if this
kingdom can bear such a loss without dreadful
consequences.—These consequences have been
amply represented by others; and it is needless
to enter into any account of them—At the
time we shall be feeling them—The Empire
dismembered; the blood of thousands shed in an
unrighteous quarrel; our strength exhausted; our
merchants breaking; our manufacturers starving;
our debts increasing; the revenue sinking; the
funds tottering; and all the miseries of a public
bankruptcy impending—At such a <i>crisis</i> should
our natural enemies, eager for our ruin, seize the opportunity—The
apprehension is too distressing.—Let
us view this subject in another light.</p>

<p class="tb">On this occasion, particular attention should be
given to the present <span class="smcapuc">SINGULAR</span> situation of this
kingdom. This is a circumstance of the utmost
importance; and as I am afraid it is not much
considered, I will beg leave to give a distinct account
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_74" id="Page_1_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>At the <span class="smcap">Revolution</span>, the <i>specie</i> of the kingdom
amounted, according to<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> <i>Davenant’</i>s account, to
eighteen millions and a half.—From the <span class="smcap">Accession</span>
to the year 1772, there were coined at the
mint, near 29 millions of gold; and in ten years
only of this time, or from January 1759 to January
1769, there were coined eight millions and a
half.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> But it has appeared lately, that the gold
specie now left in the kingdom is no more than
about twelve millions and a half.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>—Not so much
as half a million of <i>Silver specie</i> has been coined
these sixty years; and it cannot be supposed, that
the quantity of it now in circulation exceeds two
or three millions. The whole specie of the kingdom,
therefore, is probably at this time about
fifteen millions. Of this some millions must
be hoarded at the <i>Bank</i>.—Our circulating
<i>specie</i>, therefore, appears to be decreased.
But our wealth, or the quantity of money in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_75" id="Page_1_75">[75]</a></span>
the kingdom, is greatly increased. This is paper
to a vast amount, issued in almost every corner of
the kingdom; and, particularly, by the <span class="smcap">Bank of
England</span>. While this paper maintains its credit
it answers all the purposes of specie, and is in all
respects the same with money.</p>

<p>Specie represents some real value in goods or
commodities. On the contrary; paper represents
immediately nothing but specie. It is a promise
or obligation which the emitter brings himself under
to pay a given sum in coin; and it owes its
currency to the credit of the emitter; or to an
opinion that he is able to make good his engagement;
and that the sum specified may be received
upon being demanded.—Paper, therefore, represents
coin; and coin represents real value. That
is, the one is a <i>sign</i> of wealth. The other is the
<i>sign</i> of that <i>sign</i>.—But farther. Coin is an <i>universal</i>
sign of wealth, and will procure it every
where. It will bear any alarm, and stand any
shock.—On the contrary. Paper, owing its
currency to opinion, has only a local and imaginary
value. It can stand no shock. It is destroyed
by the approach of danger; or even the <i>suspicion</i>
of danger.</p>

<p>In short. Coin is the basis of our paper-credit;
and were it either all destroyed, or were only the
quantity of it reduced beyond a certain limit, the
paper circulation of the kingdom would sink at
once. But, were our paper destroyed, the coin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_76" id="Page_1_76">[76]</a></span>
would not only remain, but rise in value, in proportion
to the quantity of paper destroyed.</p>

<p>From this account it follows, that as far as, in
any circumstances, specie is not to be procured in
exchange for paper, it represents <i>nothing</i>, and is,
worth <i>nothing</i>.—The specie of this kingdom is
inconsiderable, compared with the amount of the
paper circulating in it. This is generally believed;
and, therefore, it is natural to enquire how its
currency is supported.—The answer is easy. It
is supported in the same manner with all other
bubbles. Were all to demand specie in exchange
for their notes, payment could not be made; but,
at the same time that this is known, every one
trusts, that no alarm producing such a demand will
happen, while he holds the paper he is possessed of;
and that if it should happen, he will stand a chance
for being first paid; and this makes him easy.
And it also makes all with whom he traffics easy.—But
let any events happen which threaten danger;
and every one will become diffident. A run will
take place; and a bankruptcy follow.</p>

<p>This is an account of what has often happened
in <i>private</i> credit. And it is also an account of
what <i>will</i> (if no change of measures takes place)
happen some time or other in <i>public</i> credit. The
description I have given of our paper-circulation
implies, that nothing can be more delicate or hazardous.
It is an immense fabrick, with its head
in the clouds, that is continually trembling with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_77" id="Page_1_77">[77]</a></span>
every adverse blast and every fluctuation of trade;
and which, like the baseless fabrick of a vision,
may in a moment vanish, and leave no wreck behind.—The
destruction of a few books at the
<i>Bank</i>; an improvement in the art of forgery; the
landing of a body of <i>French</i> troops on our coasts;
insurrections threatening a revolution in government;
or any events that should produce a general
panic, however groundless, would at once annihilate
it, and leave us without any other medium
of traffic, than a quantity of <i>specie</i> not
much more than the money now drawn from
the public by the taxes. It would, therefore,
become impossible to pay the taxes. The revenue
would fail. Near a hundred and forty millions of
property would be destroyed. The whole frame of
government would fall to pieces; and a state of nature
would take place.—What a dreadful situation!
It has never had a parallel among mankind;
except at one time in <i>France</i> after the establishment
there of the Royal <i>Mississipi</i> Bank. In 1720 this
bank broke;<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and, after involving for some
time the whole kingdom in a golden dream, spread
through it in one day, desolation and ruin.—The
distress attending such an event, in this free
country, would be greater than it was in <i>France</i>.
Happily for that kingdom, they have shot this
gulph. Paper-credit has never since recovered itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_78" id="Page_1_78">[78]</a></span>
there; and their circulating cash consists now
all of solid coin, amounting, according to the lowest
account, to no less a sum than 1500 millions of <i>Livres</i>;<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
or near 67 millions of pounds sterling. This
gives them unspeakable advantages; and, joined to
that quick reduction of their debts which is inseparable<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
from their nature, places them on a ground
of safety which we have reason to admire and envy.</p>

<p class="tb">These are subjects on which I should have chosen
to be silent, did I not think it necessary, that
this country should be apprized and warned of the
danger which threatens it. This danger is created
chiefly by the national debt. High taxes are necessary
to support a great public debt; and a large
supply of cash is necessary to support high taxes.
This cash we owe to our paper; and, in proportion
to our paper, must be the productiveness of
our taxes.—King William’s wars drained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_79" id="Page_1_79">[79]</a></span>
kingdom of its specie. This sunk the revenue,
and distressed government. In 1694 the <span class="smcap">Bank</span>
was established; and the kingdom was provided
with a substitute for specie. The taxes became
again productive. The revenue rose; and government
was relieved.—Ever since that period
our paper and taxes have been increasing together,
and supporting one another; and one reason,
undoubtedly, of the late increase in the productiveness
of our taxes has been the increase of our
paper.</p>

<p>Was there no public debt, there would be no
occasion for half the present taxes. Our paper-circulation
might be reduced. The balance of
trade would turn in our favour. Specie would
flow in upon us. The quantity of property destroyed
by a failure of paper-credit (should it in
such circumstances happen) would be 140 millions
less; and, therefore, the shock attending it would
be <i>tolerable</i>. But, in the present state of things,
whenever any calamity or panic shall produce
such a failure, the shock attending it will be <i>intolerable</i>.—May
heaven soon raise up for us
some great statesman who shall see these things;
and enter into effectual measures, if not now too
late, for extricating and preserving us.</p>

<p>Public banks are, undoubtedly, attended with
great conveniences. But they also do great harm;
and, if their emissions are not restrained, and conducted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_80" id="Page_1_80">[80]</a></span>
with great wisdom, they may prove the
most pernicious of all institutions; not only, by
substituting <i>fictitious</i> for <i>real</i> wealth; by increasing
luxury; by raising the prices of provisions;
by concealing an unfavourable balance of trade;
and by rendering a kingdom incapable of bearing
any <i>internal</i> tumults or <i>external</i> attacks, without
the danger of a dreadful convulsion: But, particularly,
by becoming instruments in the hands of
ministers of state to increase their influence, to
lessen their dependence on the people, and to
keep up a delusive shew of public prosperity, when
perhaps ruin may be near. There is, in truth,
nothing that a government may not do with such
a mine at its command as a public Bank, while it
can maintain its credit; nor, therefore, is there any
thing more likely to be <span class="smcapuc">IMPROPERLY</span> and <span class="smcapuc">DANGEROUSLY</span>
used.—But to return to what may be more
applicable to our own state at present.</p>

<p class="tb">Among the causes that may produce a failure
of paper-credit, there are two which the present
quarrel with <i>America</i> calls upon us particularly to
consider.—The first is, “An unfavourable balance
of trade.” This, in proportion to the degree
in which it takes place, must turn the course
of foreign exchange against us; raise the price of
bullion; and carry off our specie. The danger to
which this would expose us is obvious; and it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_81" id="Page_1_81">[81]</a></span>
been much increased by the new coinage of the
gold specie which begun in 1773. Before this
coinage, the greatest part of our gold coin being
light, but the same in currency as if it had been
heavy, always remained in the kingdom. But,
being now nearly of full weight, whenever a wrong
balance of foreign trade alters the course of exchange,
and gold in <i>coin</i> becomes of less value than
in <i>bullion</i>, there is reason to fear, that it will be
melted down in such great quantities, and exported
so fast, as in a little time to leave none behind;<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
the consequence which must prove, that the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_82" id="Page_1_82">[82]</a></span>
superstructure of paper-credit, now supported by
it, will break down.—The only remedy, in such
circumstances, is an increase of coinage at the
mint. But this will operate too slowly; and, by
raising the price of bullion, will only increase the
evil.—It is the <i>Bank</i> that at such a time must be
the immediate sufferer: For it is from thence that
those who want coin for any purpose will always
draw it.</p>

<p>For many years before 1773, the price of gold
in <i>bullion</i> had been, from 2 to 3 or 4 <i>per cent</i>.
higher than in <i>coin</i>. This was a temptation to melt
down and export the coin, which could not be resisted.
Hence arose a demand for it on the <span class="smcap">Bank</span>;
and, consequently, the necessity of purchasing bullion
at a loss for a new coinage. But the more
coin the Bank procured in this way, the lower its
price became in comparison with that of bullion,
and the faster it vanished; and, consequently, the
more necessary it became to coin again, and the
greater loss fell upon the Bank.—Had things
continued much longer in this train, the consequences
might have proved very serious. I am by
no means sufficiently informed to be able to assign
the causes which have produced the change that
happened in 1772. But, without doubt, the state
of things which took place before that year must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_83" id="Page_1_83">[83]</a></span>
expected to return. The fluctuations of trade, in
its best state, render this unavoidable. But the contest
with our Colonies has a tendency to bring it
on soon; and to increase unspeakably the distress
attending it. All know that the balance of trade
with them is greatly in our favour;<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and that this
balance is paid partly by direct remittances of bullion;
and partly by circuitous remittances through
<i>Spain</i>, <i>Portugal</i>, <i>Italy</i>, &amp;c. which diminish the balance
against us with these countries.—During the
last year they have been employed in paying their
debts, without adding to them; and their exportations
and remittances for that purpose have contributed
to render the general balance of trade
more favourable to us, and, also, (in conjunction
with the late operations of the Bank) to keep up
our funds. These remittances are now ceased;
and a few years will determine, if this contest
goes on, how far we can sustain such a loss
without suffering the consequences I have described.</p>

<p>The second event, ruinous to our paper circulation,
which may arise from our rupture with
<i>America</i>, is a deficiency in the revenue. As a failure
of our paper would destroy the revenue, so a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_84" id="Page_1_84">[84]</a></span>
failure of the revenue, or any considerable diminution
of it, would destroy our paper. The <span class="smcap">Bank</span>
is the support of our paper; and the support of the
<span class="smcap">Bank</span> is the credit of government. Its principal
securities, are a capital of eleven millions lent to
government; and money continually advanced to a
vast amount on the Land-tax and Malt-tax, Sinking
Fund, Exchequer Bills, Navy Bills, &amp;c. Should,
therefore, deficiencies in the revenue bring government
under any difficulties, all these securities would
lose their value, and the <i>Bank</i> and Government, and
all private and public credit, would fall together.—Let
any one here imagine, what would probably
follow, were it but suspected by the public in general,
that the taxes were so fallen, as not to produce
enough to pay the interest of the public debts,
besides bearing the <i>ordinary</i> expences of the nation;
and that, in order to supply the deficiency
and to hide the calamity, it had been necessary in
any one year to anticipate the taxes, and to borrow
of the Bank.—In such circumstances I can
scarcely doubt, but an alarm would spread of the
most dangerous tendency.—The next foreign
war, should it prove <i>half</i> as expensive as the last,
will probably occasion such a deficiency; and
bring our affairs to that crisis towards which they
have been long tending.—But the war with
<i>America</i> has a greater tendency to do this; and the
reason is, that it affects our resources more; and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_85" id="Page_1_85">[85]</a></span>
attended more with the danger of internal disturbances.</p>

<p>Some have made the proportion of our trade depending
on <i>North America</i> to be near <span class="smcapuc">ONE HALF</span>. A
moderate computation makes it a <span class="smcapuc">THIRD</span>.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Let
it, however, be supposed to be only a <span class="smcapuc">FOURTH</span>. I
will venture to say, this is a proportion of our foreign
trade, the loss of which, when it comes to be
felt, will be found insupportable.—In the article
of <i>Tobacco</i> alone it will cause a deduction from the
<i>Customs</i> of at least 300,000<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i><a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> including
the duties paid on foreign commodities purchased
by the exportation of tobacco. Let the whole deduction
from the revenue be supposed to be only
half a million. This alone is more than the kingdom
can at present bear, without having recourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_86" id="Page_1_86">[86]</a></span>
to lotteries, and the land-tax at 4s. in order to defray
the common and necessary expences of peace.
But to this must be added a deduction from the
produce of the <i>Excises</i>, in consequence of the increase
of the poor, of the difficulties of our merchants
and manufacturers, of less national wealth,
and a retrenchment of luxury. There is no possibility
of knowing to what these deductions may
amount. When the evils producing them begin,
they will proceed rapidly; and they may end in a
general wreck before we are aware of any danger.</p>

<p>In order to give a clearer view of this subject, I
will in an Appendix<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>, state particularly the national
expenditure and income for eleven years, from 1764
to 1774. From that account it will appear, that
the money drawn every year from the public by
the taxes, does not fall greatly short of a sum equal
to the whole <i>specie</i> of the kingdom; and that, notwithstanding
the late increase in the productiveness
of the taxes, the whole surplus of the national income
has not exceeded 338,759l. <i>per ann.</i> See
the Second Tract, <a href="#Page_2_160">p. 160</a>. This is a surplus so inconsiderable
as to be scarcely sufficient to guard
against the deficiencies arising from the common
fluctuations of foreign trade, and of home consumption.
It is <span class="smcapuc">NOTHING</span> when considered as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_87" id="Page_1_87">[87]</a></span>
only fund we have for paying off a debt of near
140 millions.—Had we continued in a state of
profound peace, it could not have admitted of
any diminution. What then must follow, when
one of the most profitable branches of our trade is
destroyed; when a <span class="smcapuc">THIRD</span> of the Empire is lost;
when an addition of many millions is made to the
public debt; and when, at the same time, perhaps
some millions are taken away from the revenue?—I
shudder at this prospect.—<span class="smcap">A kingdom
on an edge so perilous, should think of nothing
but a retreat.</span></p>

<h3 id="I_PART_II_SECT_IV">SECT. IV.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Honour of the Nation as affected by
the War with <span class="antiqua">America</span>.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">One of the pleas for continuing the contest
with <i>America</i> is, “That our honour is engaged;
and that we cannot now recede without
the most humiliating concessions.”</p>

<p>With respect to this, it is proper to observe, that
a distinction should be made between the nation,
and its rulers. It is melancholy that there should be
ever any reason for making such a distinction. A government
is, or ought to be, nothing but an institution
for collecting and for carrying into execution the
will of the people. But so far is this from being in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_88" id="Page_1_88">[88]</a></span>
general the fact, that the measures of government,
and the sense of the people, are sometimes in direct
opposition to one another; nor does it <i>often</i>
happen that any certain conclusion can be drawn
from the one to the other.—I will not pretend to
determine, whether, in the present instance, the dishonour
attending a retreat would belong to the
nation at large, or only to the persons in power who
guide its affairs. Be this as it will, no good argument
can be drawn from it against receding.
The disgrace which may be implied in making
concessions, is nothing to that of being the aggressors
in an unrighteous quarrel; and dignity,
in such circumstances, consists in retracting freely
and speedily.—For, (to adopt on this occasion,
words which I have heard applied to
this very purpose, in a great assembly, by a peer
to whom this kingdom has often looked as its deliverer,
and whose ill state of health at this awful
moment of public danger every friend to <i>Britain</i>
must deplore) to adopt, I say, the words of this
great man—“<span class="smcap">Rectitude is dignity. Oppression
only is meanness; and justice, honour.</span>”</p>

<p>I will add, that <span class="smcap">Prudence</span>, no less than true
<span class="smcap">Honour</span>, requires us to retract. For the time
may come when, if it is not done voluntarily, we
may be <i>obliged</i> to do it; and find ourselves under
a necessity of granting that to our distresses, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_89" id="Page_1_89">[89]</a></span>
we now deny to equity and humanity, and the
prayers of <i>America</i>. The possibility of this appears
plainly from the preceding pages; and
should it happen, it will bring upon us disgrace
indeed, disgrace greater than the worst rancour
can wish to see accumulated on a kingdom already
too much dishonoured.—Let the reader think
here what we are doing.—A nation, once the
protector of Liberty in distant countries, and the
scourge of tyranny, changed into an enemy to
Liberty, and engaged in endeavouring to reduce
to servitude its own brethren.—A great and enlightened
nation, not content with a controuling
power over millions of people which gave it every
reasonable advantage, insisting upon such a supremacy
over them as would leave them nothing
they could call their own, and carrying desolation
and death among them for disputing it.—What
can be more ignominious?—How
have we felt for the brave <i>Corsicans</i>, in their
struggle with the <i>Genoese</i>, and afterwards with the
<i>French</i> government? Did <span class="smcap">Genoa</span> or <span class="smcap">France</span>
want more than an absolute command over their
property and legislations; or the power of binding
them in all cases whatsoever?—The <i>Genoese</i>,
finding it difficult to keep them in subjection,
<span class="smcapuc">CEDED</span> them to the <i>French</i>.—All such cessions
of one people by another are disgraceful to human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_90" id="Page_1_90">[90]</a></span>
nature. But if our claims are just, may not
we also, if we please, <span class="smcapuc">CEDE</span> the Colonies to <i>France</i>?—There
is, in truth, no other difference between
these two cases than that the <i>Corsicans</i> were
not descended from the people who governed them,
but that the <i>Americans</i> are.</p>

<p>There are some who seem to be sensible, that
the authority of one country over another, cannot
be distinguished from the servitude of one country
to another; and that unless different communities,
as well as different parts of the same community,
are united by an equal representation, all
such authority is inconsistent with the principles of
Civil Liberty.—But they except the case of the
Colonies and <i>Great Britain</i>; because the Colonies
are communities which have branched forth from,
and which, therefore, as they think, belong to
<i>Britain</i>. Had the colonies been communities of
<i>foreigners</i>, over whom we wanted to acquire dominion,
or even to extend a dominion before acquired,
they are ready to admit that their resistance
would have been just.—In my opinion, this is
the same with saying, that the Colonies ought to
be worse off than the rest of mankind, because they
are our own <i>Brethren</i>.</p>

<p>Again. The United Provinces of <i>Holland</i> were
once subject to the <i>Spanish</i> monarchy; but, provoked
by the violation of their charters; by levies
of money, without their consent; by the introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_91" id="Page_1_91">[91]</a></span>
of Spanish troops among them; by innovations
in their antient modes of government; and
the rejection of their petitions; they were driven to
that resistance which we and all the world have
ever since admired; and which has given birth to
one of the greatest and happiest Republics that
ever existed.—Let any one read also, the history
of the war which the <i>Athenians</i>, from a thirst
of Empire, made on the <i>Syracusans</i> in <i>Sicily</i>, a people
derived from the same origin with them; and
let him, if he can, avoid rejoicing in the defeat of
the <i>Athenians</i>.</p>

<p>Let him, likewise, read the account of the social
war among the Romans. The allied states of
<i>Italy</i> had fought the battles of <i>Rome</i>, and contributed
by their valour and treasure to its conquests
and grandeur. They claimed, therefore, the rights
of Roman citizens, and a share with them in
legislation. The Romans, disdaining to make those
their <i>fellow-citizens</i>, whom they had always looked
upon as their <i>subjects</i>, would not comply; and
a war followed, the most horrible in the annals
of mankind, which ended in the ruin of the Roman
Republic. The feelings of every <i>Briton</i> in
this case must force him to approve the conduct
of the Allies, and to condemn the proud and ungrateful
Romans.</p>

<p>But not only is the present contest with <i>America</i>
thus disgraceful to us, because inconsistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_92" id="Page_1_92">[92]</a></span>
with our own feelings in similar cases; but also
because condemned by our own practice in former
times. The Colonies are persuaded that they are
fighting for Liberty. We see them sacrificing to
this persuasion every private advantage. If mistaken,
and though guilty of irregularities, they
should be pardoned by a people whose ancestors
have given them so many examples of similar conduct.
<span class="smcap">England</span> should venerate the attachment
to Liberty amidst all its excesses; and, instead of
indignation or scorn, it would be most becoming
them, in the present instance, to declare their applause,
and to say to the Colonies—“We excuse
your mistakes. We admire your spirit.
It is the spirit that has more than once saved
<i>ourselves</i>. We aspire to no dominion over you.
We understand the rights of men too well to
think of taking from you the inestimable privilege
of governing yourselves; and, instead of
employing our power for any such purpose,
we offer it to you as a friendly and guardian
power, to be a mediator in your quarrels; a
protection against your enemies; and an aid
to you in establishing a plan of Liberty that shall
make you great and happy. In return, we
ask nothing but your gratitude and your commerce.”</p>

<p>This would be a language worthy of a brave
and enlightened nation. But alas! it often happens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_93" id="Page_1_93">[93]</a></span>
in the <i>Political World</i> as it does in <i>Religion</i>,
that the people who cry out most vehemently for
Liberty to themselves are the most unwilling to
grant it to others.</p>

<p>But farther. This war is disgraceful on account
of the persuasion which led to it, and under which
it has been undertaken. The general cry was
last winter, that the people of <span class="smcap">New-England</span>
were a body of cowards, who would at once be
reduced to submission by a hostile look from our
troops. In this light were they held up to public
derision in both Houses of Parliament; and it was
this persuasion that, probably, induced a Nobleman
of the first weight in the state to recommend,
at the passing of the <i>Boston Port Bill</i>, coercive
measures; hinting at the same time, that the <i>appearance</i>
of hostilities would be sufficient, and that
all would be soon over, <span class="smcapuc">SINE CLADE</span>.—Indeed no
one can doubt, but that had it been believed some
time ago, that the people of <i>America</i> were brave,
more care would have been taken not to provoke
them.</p>

<p>Again. The manner in which this war has
been hitherto conducted, renders it still more disgraceful.—English
valour being thought insufficient
to subdue the Colonies, the laws and religion
of <i>France</i> were established in <i>Canada</i>, on purpose to
obtain the power of bringing upon them from
thence an army of <i>French Papists</i>. The wild <i>Indians</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_94" id="Page_1_94">[94]</a></span>
and their own Slaves have been instigated to
attack them; and attempts have been made to
gain the assistance of a large body of <i>Russians</i>.—With
like views, <i>German</i> troops have been hired;
and the defence of our Forts and Garrisons trusted
in their hands.</p>

<p>These are measures which need no comment.
The last of them, in particular, having been carried
into execution without the consent of parliament,
threatens us with imminent danger; and shews
that we are in the way to lose even the <i>Forms</i> of
the constitution.—If, indeed, our ministers can
at any time, without leave, not only send away
the national troops, but introduce <i>foreign</i> troops
in their room, we lie entirely at mercy; and we
have every thing to dread.</p>

<h3 id="I_PART_II_SECT_V">SECT. V.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Probability of Succeeding in the War
with <span class="antiqua">America</span>.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Let us next consider how far there is a possibility
of succeeding in the present war.</p>

<p>Our own people, being unwilling to enlist, and
the attempts to procure armies of <i>Russians</i>, <i>Indians</i>,
and <i>Canadians</i> having miscarried; the utmost force
we can employ, including foreigners, does not exceed,
if I am rightly informed, 40,000 effective men.
This is the force that is to conquer half a million <i>at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_95" id="Page_1_95">[95]</a></span>
least</i><a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> of determined men fighting on their own
ground, within sight of their houses and families,
and for that sacred blessing of Liberty, without
which man is a beast, and government a curse.
All history proves, that in such a situation, a handful
is a match for millions.</p>

<p>In the <i>Netherlands</i>, a few states thus circumstanced,
withstood, for a long course of years, the
whole force of the Spanish monarchy, when at its
zenith; and at last humbled its pride, and emancipated
themselves from its tyranny.—The citizens of
<span class="smcap">Syracuse</span> also, thus circumstanced, withstood the
whole power of the <i>Athenians</i>, and almost ruined
them.—The same happened in the contest between
the house of <i>Austria</i>, and the cantons<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> of
<i>Switzerland</i>.—There is in this case an infinite
difference between attacking and being attacked;
between fighting to <i>destroy</i>, and fighting to <i>preserve</i>
or <i>acquire</i> Liberty.—Were we, therefore, capable
of employing a <i>land</i> force against <i>America</i>
equal to its own, there would be little probability
of success. But to think of conquering that whole
continent with 30,000 or 40,000 men to be transported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_96" id="Page_1_96">[96]</a></span>
across the <i>Atlantic</i>, and fed from hence,
and incapable of being recruited after any defeat—This
is indeed a folly so great, that language
does not afford a name for it.</p>

<p>With respect to our naval force, could it sail at
land as it does at sea, much might be done with it;
but as that is impossible, <i>little</i> or <i>nothing</i> can be
done with it, which will not hurt <i>ourselves</i> more
than the <i>Colonists</i>.—Such of their maritime towns
as they cannot guard against our fleets, and have
not been already destroyed, they are determined
either to give up to our resentment, or destroy
themselves: The consequence of which will be,
that these towns will be rebuilt in safer situations;
and that we shall lose some of the principal pledges
by which we have hitherto held them in subjection.—As
to their trade; having all the necessaries
and the chief conveniencies of life within
themselves, they have no dependence upon it;
and the loss of it will do them unspeakable good,
by preserving them from the evils of luxury and
the temptations of wealth; and keeping them in
that state of virtuous simplicity which is the greatest
happiness. I know that I am now speaking
the sense of some of the wisest men in America.
It has been long their wish that <i>Britain</i> would shut
up all their ports. They will rejoice, particularly,
in the last restraining act. It might have happened,
that the people would have grown weary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_97" id="Page_1_97">[97]</a></span>
their agreements not to export or import. But
this act will oblige them to keep these agreements;
and confirm their unanimity and zeal.
It will also furnish them with a reason for confiscating
the estates of all the friends of our government
among them, and for employing their sailors,
who would have been otherwise idle, in making
reprisals on British property. Their ships, before
useless, and consisting of many hundreds, will be
turned into ships of war; and that attention,
which they have hitherto confined to trade, will be
employed in fitting out a naval force for their own
defence; and thus the way will be prepared for
their becoming, much sooner than they would
otherwise have been, a great maritime power.
This act of parliament, therefore, crowns the folly
of all our late measures.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>—None who know me,
can believe me to be disposed to superstition. Perhaps,
however, I am not in the present instance,
free from this weakness.—I fancy I see in these
measures something that cannot be accounted for
merely by human ignorance. I am inclined to
think, that the hand of Providence is in them
working to bring about some great ends.—But
this leads me to one consideration more, which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_98" id="Page_1_98">[98]</a></span>
cannot help offering to the public, and which appears
to me in the highest degree important.</p>

<p>In this hour of tremendous danger, it would become
us to turn our thoughts to Heaven. This
is what our brethren in the Colonies are doing.
From one end of <i>North America</i> to the other,
they are <span class="smcapuc">FASTING</span> and <span class="smcapuc">PRAYING</span>. But what are
we doing?—We are ridiculing them as <i>Fanatics</i>,
and scoffing at religion.—We are running wild
after pleasure, and forgetting every thing serious
and decent at <i>Masquerades</i>.—We are trafficking
for Boroughs; perjuring ourselves at Elections;
and selling ourselves for places.—Which
side then is Providence likely to favour?</p>

<p>In <i>America</i> we see a number of rising states in the
vigour of youth, inspired by the noblest of all
passions, the passion for being free; and animated
by piety.—<i>Here</i> we see an old state, great indeed,
but inflated and irreligious; enervated by
luxury; encumbred with debts; and hanging by
a thread.—Can any one look without pain to the
issue? May we not expect calamities that shall
recover to <i>reflection</i> (perhaps to <i>devotion</i>) our <i>Libertines</i>
and <i>Atheists</i>?</p>

<p>Is our cause such as gives us reason to ask God
to bless it?—Can we in the face of Heaven declare,
“that we are not the aggressors in this war;
and that we mean by it, not to acquire or even
preserve dominion for its own sake; not conquest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_99" id="Page_1_99">[99]</a></span>
or Empire, or the gratification of resentment;
but solely to deliver ourselves from oppression;
to gain reparation for injury; and
to defend ourselves against men who would plunder
or kill us?”—Remember, reader, whoever
thou art, that there are no other just causes of war;
and that blood spilled, with any ether views, must
some time or other be accounted for.—But not
to expose myself by saying more in this way, I will
now beg leave to recapitulate some of the arguments
I have used; and to deliver the feelings
of my heart in a brief, but earnest address to my
countrymen.</p>

<p class="tb">I am hearing it continually urged—“Are
they not our subjects?”—The plain answer is,
they are not your subjects. The people of <i>America</i>
are no more the subjects of the people of <i>Britain</i>,
than the people of <i>Yorkshire</i> are the subjects
of the people of <i>Middlesex</i>. They are your <i>fellow-subjects</i>.</p>

<p>“But <i>we</i> are taxed; and why should not <i>they</i>
be taxed?”—<i>You</i> are taxed by yourselves. <i>They</i>
insist on the same privilege.—They are taxed
to support their own governments; and they help
also to pay your taxes by purchasing your manufactures,
and giving you a monopoly of their
trade. Must they maintain <i>two</i> governments?
Must they submit to be <i>triple</i> taxed?—Has your
moderation in taxing yourselves been such as encourages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_100" id="Page_1_100">[100]</a></span>
them to trust you with the power of taxing
them?</p>

<p>“But they will not obey the <i>Parliament</i> and
the <i>Laws</i>.”—Say rather, they will not obey <i>your</i>
parliament and <i>your</i> laws. Their reason is: They
have no voice in your parliament. They have no
share in making<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> your laws.—“Neither have
<i>most</i> of us.”—Then you so far want Liberty;
and your language is, “<i>We</i> are not free, Why
will <i>they</i> be free?”—But <i>many</i> of you have a
voice in parliament: <i>None</i> of them have. <i>All</i>
your freehold land is represented: But not a foot
of <i>their</i> land is represented. At worst, therefore,
you are only enslaved <i>partially</i>.—Were they
to submit, they would be enslaved <i>totally</i>.—They
are governed by parliaments chosen by themselves,
and by legislatures similar to yours. Why
will you disturb them in the enjoyment of a blessing
so valuable? Is it reasonable to insist, that
your discretion alone shall be their law; that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_101" id="Page_1_101">[101]</a></span>
shall have no constitutions of government, except
such as you shall be pleased to give them; and no
property except such as your parliament shall be
pleased to leave them?—What is your parliament?—Is
there not a growing intercourse between
it and the court? Does it awe ministers of state
as it once did?—Instead of contending for a controuling
power over the governments of <i>America,</i>
should you not think more of watching and reforming
your own?—Suppose the worst. Suppose, in
opposition to all their own declarations, that the Colonists
are now aiming at independence.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>—“If
they can subsist without you;” is it to be wondered
at? Did there ever exist a <i>community</i>, or even an <i>individual</i>,
that would not do the same?—“If they
<i>cannot</i> subsist without you;” let them alone. They
will soon come back.—“If you cannot
subsist without them,” reclaim them by<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> kindness;
engage them by moderation and equity. It
is madness to resolve to butcher them. This will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_102" id="Page_1_102">[102]</a></span>
make them detest and avoid you for ever. Freemen
are not to be governed by force; or dragooned
into compliance. If capable of bearing to be
so treated, it is a disgrace to be connected with
them.</p>

<p>“If <i>they</i> can subsist without <i>you</i>; and also <i>you</i>
without <i>them</i>,” the attempt to subjugate them
by confiscating their effects, burning their towns,
and ravaging their territories, is a wanton exertion
of cruel ambition, which, however common it has
been among mankind, deserves to be called by
harder names than I chuse to apply to it.—Suppose
such an attempt was to be succeeded:
Would it not be a fatal preparation for subduing
yourselves? Would not the disposal of <i>American</i>
places, and the distribution of an <i>American</i> revenue,
render that influence of the crown irresistible, which
has already stabbed your liberties?</p>

<p>Turn your eyes to <i>India</i>: There more has been
done than is now attempted in <i>America</i>. There
<span class="smcap">Englishmen</span>, actuated by the love of plunder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_103" id="Page_1_103">[103]</a></span>
the spirit of conquest, have depopulated whole
kingdoms, and ruined millions of innocent people
by the most infamous oppression and rapacity.—The
justice of the nation has slept over these enormities.
Will the justice of heaven sleep?—Are
we not now execrated on both sides of the globe?</p>

<p class="tb">With respect to the Colonists; it would be folly
to pretend they are faultless. They were running
fast into our vices. But this quarrel gives them a
salutary check: And it may be permitted on purpose
to favour them, and in <i>them</i> the rest of mankind;
by making way for establishing, in an
extensive country possessed of every advantage, a
plan of government, and a growing power that
will astonish the world, and under which every
subject of human enquiry shall be open to free discussion,
and the friends of Liberty, in every quarter
of the globe, find a safe retreat from civil and spiritual
tyranny.—I hope, therefore, our brethren
in <i>America</i> will forgive their oppressors. It is certain
<i>they know not what they are doing</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_104" id="Page_1_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Having said so much of the war with
America, and particularly of the danger with
which it threatens us, it may be expected that I
should propose some method of escaping from this
danger, and of restoring this once happy Empire
to a state of peace and security.—Various plans of
pacification have been proposed; and some of
them, by persons so distinguished by their rank and
merit, as to be above my applause. But till there
is more of a disposition to attend to such plans;
they cannot, I am afraid, be of any great service.
And there is too much reason to apprehend, that
nothing but calamity will bring us to repentance
and wisdom.—In order, however, to complete
my design in these observations, I will take the liberty
to lay before the public the following sketch
of one of the plans just referred to, as it was opened
before the holidays to the house of Lords by
the <i>Earl of Shelburne</i>; who, while he held the seals
of the Southern Department, with the business of
the Colonies annexed, possessed their confidence,
without ever compromising the authority of this
country; a confidence which discovered itself by
peace among themselves, and duty and submission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_105" id="Page_1_105">[105]</a></span>
to the Mother-country. I hope I shall not take an
unwarrantable liberty, if, on this occasion, I use his
Lordship’s own words, as nearly as I have been
able to collect them.</p>

<p>“Meet the Colonies on their own ground, in
the last petition from the Congress to the king.
The surest, as well as the most dignified
mode of proceeding for this country.—Suspend
all hostilities—Repeal the acts which immediately
distress America, namely, the last restraining
act,—the charter act,—the act for the
more impartial administration of justice;—and
the Quebec act.—All the other acts (the custom
house act, the post office act, &amp;c.) leave to a temperate
revisal.—There will be found much
matter which both countries may wish repealed.
<i>Some</i> which can never be given up, the principle
being that regulation of trade for the
common good of the Empire, which forms our
<i>Palladium</i>. <i>Other</i> matter which is fair subject of
mutual accommodation.—Prescribe the most
explicit acknowledgment of your right of regulating
commerce in its most extensive sense; if
the petition and other public acts of the Colonies
have not already, by their declarations and acknowledgments,
left it upon a sufficiently secure
foundation.—Besides the power of regulating the
general commerce of the Empire, something
further might be expected; provided a due and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_106" id="Page_1_106">[106]</a></span>
tender regard were had to the means and abilities
of the several provinces, as well as to those
fundamental, unalienable rights of <i>Englishmen</i>,
which no father can surrender on the part of his
son, no representative on the part of his elector,
no generation on the part of the succeeding one;
the right of judging not only of the <i>mode</i> of
raising, but the <i>quantum</i>, and the appropriation
of such aids as they shall grant.—To be more
explicit; the debt of <i>England</i>, without entering
into invidious distinctions how it came to be
contracted, might be acknowledged the debt of
every individual part of the whole Empire,
Asia, as well as America, included.—Provided,
that full security were held forth to them,
that such free aids, together with the Sinking
Fund (Great Britain contributing her superior
share) should not be left as the privy purse of
the minister, but be unalienably appropriated to
the original intention of that fund, the discharge
of the debt;—and that by an honest application
of the <i>whole</i> fund, the taxes might in time be lessened,
and the price of our manufactures consequently
reduced, so that every contributory part
might feel the returning benefit—always supposing
the laws of trade duly observed and enforced.</p>

<p>“The time <i>was</i>, I am confident—and perhaps
<i>is</i>, when these points might be obtained
upon the easy, the constitutional, and,
therefore, the indispensible terms of an exemption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_107" id="Page_1_107">[107]</a></span>
from parliamentary taxation, and an admission
of the sacredness of their charters; instead
of sacrificing their good humour, their affection,
their effectual aids, and the act of <span class="smcapuc">NAVIGATION</span>
itself, (which you are now in the direct
road to do) for a commercial quit-rent,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> or a
barren metaphysical chimæra.—How long
these ends may continue attainable, no man can
tell.—But if no words are to be relied on except
such as make against the Colonies—If
nothing is acceptable, except what is attainable
by force; it only remains to apply, what has
been so often remarked of unhappy periods,—<i>Quos
deus vult, &amp;c.</i>”</p>

<p>These are sentiments and proposals of the last
importance; and I am very happy in being able
to give them to the public from so respectable an
authority as that of the distinguished Peer I have
mentioned; to whom, I know, this kingdom, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_108" id="Page_1_108">[108]</a></span>
well as America, is much indebted for his zeal
to promote those grand public points on which the
preservation of Liberty among us depends; and
for the firm opposition which, jointly with many
others (Noblemen and Commoners of the first character
and abilities,) he has made to the present
measures.</p>

<p>Had such a plan as that now proposed been
adopted a few months ago, I have little doubt but
that a pacification would have taken place, on
terms highly advantageous to this kingdom.—In
particular. It is probable, that the Colonies
would have consented to grant an annual supply,
which, increased by a saving of the money now
spent in maintaining troops among them, and by
contributions which might have been gained from
other parts of the Empire, would have formed a
fund considerable enough, if unalienably applied,
to redeem the public debt; in consequence
of which, agreeably to Lord Shelburne’s
ideas, some of our worst taxes might be
taken off, and the Colonies would receive our manufactures
cheaper; our paper-currency might be
restrained; our whole force would be free to meet
at any time foreign danger; the influence of the
Crown would be reduced; our Parliament would
become less dependent; and the kingdom
might, perhaps, be restored to a situation of permanent
safety and prosperity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_109" id="Page_1_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>To conclude.—An important revolution in
the affairs of this kingdom seems to be approaching.
If ruin is not to be our lot, all that has been
lately done must be undone, and new measures
adopted. At that period, an opportunity (never
perhaps to be recovered, if lost) will offer itself
for serving essentially <i>this country</i>, as well as <i>America</i>;
by putting the national debt into a <i>fixed</i>
course of payment; by subjecting to new regulations,
the administration of the finances; and by
establishing measures for exterminating corruption
and restoring the constitution.—For my own
part; if this is not to be the consequence of any
future changes in the ministry, and the system of
corruption, lately so much improved, is to go on;
I think it totally indifferent to the kingdom who
are <i>in</i>, or who are <i>out</i> of power.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_111" id="Page_1_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The following fact is of so much importance,
that I cannot satisfy myself without
laying it before the public.—In a Committee
of the American <span class="smcap">Congress</span> in <i>June</i> 1775, a declaration
was drawn up containing an offer to
<span class="smcap">Great Britain</span>, “that the Colonies would not
only continue to grant extraordinary aids in
time of war, but also, if allowed a free commerce,
pay into the <span class="smcap">Sinking-Fund</span> such a sum
annually for <span class="smcapuc">ONE HUNDRED YEARS</span>, as should
be <i>more</i> than sufficient in that time, if faithfully
applied, to extinguish all the present debts of
<span class="smcap">Britain</span>. Or, provided this was not accepted,
that, to remove the groundless jealousy of <i>Britain</i>
that the Colonies aimed at Independence
and an abolition of the Navigation Act, which
in truth, they had never intended; and also, to
avoid all future disputes about the right of making
that and other Acts for regulating their
commerce for the general benefit, they would
enter into a covenant with <i>Britain</i>, that she
should fully possess and exercise that right for
<i>one hundred years</i> to come.”</p>

<p class="tb">At the end of the preceding Tract I have had
the honor of laying before the public the
Earl of <i>Shelburne</i>’s plan of Pacification with the
Colonies. In that plan, it is particularly proposed,
that the Colonies should grant an annual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_112" id="Page_1_112">[112]</a></span>
supply to be carried to the Sinking Fund, and unalienably
appropriated to the discharge of the public
debt.—It must give this excellent Peer great pleasure
to learn, from this resolution, that even this
part of his plan, as well as all the other parts,
would, most probably, have been accepted by
the Colonies. For though the resolution only
offers the alternative of either a <i>free</i> trade, with
extraordinary aids and an annual supply, or an
<i>exclusive</i> trade confirmed and extended; yet there
can be little reason to doubt, but that to avoid
the calamities of the present contest, <span class="smcapuc">BOTH</span> would
have been consented to; particularly, if, on our
part, such a revisal of the laws of trade had been
offered as was proposed in Lord Shelburne’s plan.</p>

<p>The preceding resolution was, I have said,
drawn up in a Committee of the Congress. But
it was not entered in their minutes; a severe Act
of Parliament happening to arrive at that time,
which determined them not to give the sum proposed
in it.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> The independency of the Judges we esteem in this country
one of our greatest privileges.—Before the revolution
they generally, I believe, held their places <i>during pleasure</i>.
King William gave them their places <i>during good behaviour</i>.
At the accession of the present Royal Family their places were
given them <i>during good behaviour</i>, in consequence of the Act
of Settlement, 12 and 13 W. III. C. 2. But an opinion having
been entertained by some, that though their commissions were
made under the Act of Settlement to continue, during good behaviour,
yet that they determined on the demise of the Crown;
it was enacted by a statute made in the first year of his present
Majesty, Chap. 23. “That the commissions of Judges for
the time being shall be, continue, and remain in full force,
during their good behaviour, notwithstanding the demise
of his Majesty, or of any of his Heirs and Successors;”
with a proviso, “that it may be lawful for his Majesty, his
Heirs and Successors, to remove any Judge upon the address
of both Houses of Parliament.” And by the same Statute
their salaries are secured to them during the continuance of
their commissions: His Majesty, according to the preamble of
the Statute, having been pleased to declare from the Throne
to both Houses of Parliament, “That he looked upon the
independency and uprightness of Judges as essential to the
impartial administration of Justice, as one of the best securities
to the Rights and Liberties of his loving Subjects, and
as most conducive to the honour of his Crown.”</p>

<p>A worthy friend and able Lawyer has supplied me with this
note. It affords, when contrasted with that <i>dependence</i> of the
Judges which has been thought reasonable in <i>America</i>, a sad
specimen of the different manner in which a kingdom may
think proper to govern itself, and the provinces subject to it.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> This is particularly true of the <i>bounties</i> granted on some
American commodities (as pitch, tar, indigo, &amp;c.) when imported
into <i>Britain</i>; for it is well known, that the end of
granting them was, to get those commodities cheaper from the
Colonies, and in return for our manufactures, which we used
to get from <i>Russia</i> and other foreign countries. And this is
expressed in the preambles of the laws which grant these bounties.
See the Appeal to the Justice, &amp;c. page 21, third edition.
It is, therefore, strange that Doctor <span class="smcap">Tucker</span> and others, should
have insisted so much upon these bounties as favours and indulgencies
to the Colonies.—But it is still more strange, that the
same representation should have been made of the compensations
granted them for doing more during the last war in assisting
us than could have been reasonably expected; and also
of the sums we have spent in maintaining troops among them
<i>without</i> their consent; and in opposition to their wishes.—See

contended for a reduction of the standard of silver. One of his
reasons was, that it would render the silver-coin more commensurate
to the wants of the nation; and <span class="smcap">check hazardous
Paper-credit</span>.—Mr. <span class="smcap">Conduit</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">Isaac Newton’s</span> successor
in the mint, has proposed, in direct contradiction to the
laws now in being, that all the bullion imported into the
kingdom should be carried into the mint to be coined; and
only coin allowed to be exported. “The height, he says, of
paper-credit is the strongest argument for trying this and <i>every
other</i> method that is likely to increase the coinage. For
whilst paper-credit does in a great measure the business of money
at home, Merchants and Bankers are not under a necessity,
as they were formerly, of coining a quantity of specie for
their home trade; and as Paper-credit brings money to the
Merchants to be exported, the money may go away insensibly,
and <span class="smcapuc">NOT BE MISSED TILL IT BE TOO LATE</span>: And
where Paper-credit is large and increasing, if the money
be exported and the coinage decrease, <span class="smcapuc">THAT CREDIT
MAY SINK AT ONCE</span>, for want of a proportionable quantity
of <i>Specie</i>, which alone can support it in a time of distress.”—See

by William Molyneux, Esq; Dublin.—In arguing against
the authority of Communities, and all people not incorporated,

and internal legislation. Mr. Molyneux carried his views
much farther; and denied the right of <i>England</i> to make any

<p><a name="Footnote_46" id="Footnote_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> Some persons, convinced of the <i>folly</i> as well as <i>barbarity</i>
of attempting to keep the Colonies by slaughtering them,
have very humanely proposed giving them up. But the highest
authority has informed us, with great reason, “That
they are too important to be given up.”—Dr. <span class="smcap">Tucker</span> has
insisted on the depopulation, produced by migrations from this
country to the Colonies, as a reason for this measure. But,
unless the kingdom is made a prison to its inhabitants, these
migrations cannot be prevented; nor do I think that they have
any great tendency to produce depopulation. When a number
of people quit a country, there is more employment and
greater plenty of the means of subsistence left for those who remain;
and the vacancy is soon filled up. The grand causes
of depopulation are, not migrations, or even famines and
plagues, or any other <i>temporary</i> evils; but the permanent and
slowly working evils of debauchery, luxury, high taxes, and
oppression.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_47" id="Footnote_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> See the Resolutions on the <i>Nova-Scotia</i> petition reported
to the House of Commons, November 29, 1775, by Lord
North, Lord George Germaine, &amp;c. and a bill ordered to be
brought in upon the said Resolutions.—There is indeed, as
Lord Shelburne has hinted, something very astonishing in these
Resolutions. They offer a relaxation of the authority of this
country, in points to which the Colonies have always consented,
and by which we are great gainers; at the same time,
that, with a rigour which hazards the Empire, we are maintaining
its authority in points to which they will never consent;
and by which nothing can be gained.</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Before the reader enters on the following
tract, I shall beg leave to detain him while
I give a general account of the contents of it, and
make a few introductory observations.</p>

<p>In the first part of the <i>Observations on Civil
Liberty</i>, published last winter, I gave a brief account
of the nature of Liberty in general, and of
<i>Civil Liberty</i> in particular. That account appears
to me, after carefully reconsidering it, to be just;
nor do I think it in my power to improve it. In
order, however, to be as explicit as possible on
this subject, and to remove those misapprehensions
of my sentiments into which some have fallen,
I have thought proper to add the <i>supplemental</i>
and <i>explanatory</i> observations, which will be found
in the <span class="smcapuc">FIRST</span> part of this pamphlet.—In writing
with this view, I have been led to refer often to
my former pamphlet, and to repeat some of the
observations in it. But as this could not have
been avoided, it will, I hope, be excused.</p>

<p>The remarks in the <span class="smcapuc">SECOND</span> part, I offer to the
public with all the deference due to the high
station and abilities of the noble Lord, whose
speech at opening the Budget in <i>April</i> last, has
occasioned them.—These remarks, having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_viii" id="Page_2_viii">[viii]</a></span>
promised long ago, should have been published
sooner. The reasons which have produced this
delay are of little consequence to the public; and,
therefore, need not be mentioned.</p>

<p>In the first section of this <i>second</i> part, it will,
I think, appear, that I went upon as good grounds
as the nature of the case admitted, when I stated
the gold coin<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> of the kingdom at <span class="smcapuc">ABOUT
TWELVE MILLIONS AND A HALF</span>. It appears now,
indeed, to be some millions more. But this is a
discovery made by the call of last summer; which,
I find, has brought in near double the sum that
the best judges expected. Nothing, however,
very encouraging can be inferred from hence.
It only shews that a great deal of gold has been
hoarded; and will, probably, be again hoarded.
This is the natural consequence of public diffidence;
and it is a circumstance which may, hereafter,
greatly increase distress. Before the <span class="smcap">Revolution</span>,
according to Dr. <i>Davenant</i>, near half the
coin was hoarded; and the same, undoubtedly,
will be done again, whenever the nation comes to
be thoroughly alarmed.</p>

<p>In the next section of this part, I have made
some further observations on the contest with
<i>America</i>.—I cannot expect any other than a
tragical and deplorable issue to this contest. But
let events turn out as they will, I shall always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_ix" id="Page_2_ix">[ix]</a></span>
reflect with satisfaction, that I have, though a
private person of little consequence, bore my
testimony, from deep-felt conviction, against a
war which must shock the feelings and the reason
of every considerate person; a war in which
rivers of blood must be shed, not to repel the
attacks of enemies, or to maintain the authority
of government <i>within</i> the realm, but to
maintain sovereignty and dominion in another
world<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.—I wish the advocates for the measures
against <i>America</i> would attend to the distinction
now intimated.—The support of just government
<i>within</i> the realm is always necessary, and therefore
right. But to maintain, by fire and sword,
dominion over the persons and the property of a
people <i>out</i> of the realm, who have no share in
its legislature, contradicts every principle of
liberty and humanity.—Legitimate government,
let it be remembered, as opposed to oppression
and tyranny, consists “only in the dominion of
<span class="smcapuc">EQUAL LAWS</span> made with <span class="smcapuc">COMMON CONSENT</span>, or of
men over <span class="smcapuc">THEMSELVES</span>; and not in the dominion
of communities over communities, or of <span class="smcapuc">ANY
MEN OVER OTHER MEN</span>.”—This is the great truth
I have endeavoured to explain and defend; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_x" id="Page_2_x">[x]</a></span>
happy would the world be, were a due conviction
of it impressed on every human heart.</p>

<p>The representation I have given in this section
and elsewhere, of the state of this kingdom, is,
without doubt, gloomy. But it is not the effect,
as some have intimated, of either a natural disposition
to gloominess, or of sinister views. Few,
who know me, will entertain such a suspicion.
Valuing <i>most</i> what politicians and statesmen generally
value <i>least</i>, I feel myself perfectly easy with
respect to my interest as a citizen of this world;
nor is there any change of situation that can make
me happier, except a return to privacy and obscurity.
The opinion I have entertained of the
present danger of the kingdom is, therefore, the
effect of evidence which appears to me irresistible.
This evidence I have stated to the public; and
every one may judge of it as he pleases. I am
sensible of my own liableness to error. The
measures which I condemn as the worst that ever disgraced
and hazarded a great kingdom, others, whose
integrity I cannot question, approve; and that very
situation of our affairs which I think alarming,
others think prosperous. Time will determine
which of these opinions is right. But supposing
the latter to be so, no harm can arise from any
representations which have a tendency to put us
on our guard.</p>

<p>I have bestowed particular attention on the observations
in the third section of this second part;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_xi" id="Page_2_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and I think the subject of this section so important,
that it is probable, I should not have
resolved on the present publication, had it not
been for the opportunity it gives me to lay the
observations it contains before the public.—An
intimation of them was given in the Introduction
to the third edition of the Treatise on <i>Reversionary
Payments</i>. The nation being now once more got
into a course of borrowing; and our first step
having been a return to a mode of borrowing,
which had appeared to me absurd and detrimental,
I was induced to resume the subject, and to examine
it with more care. And the result of an
examination of only a <i>part</i> of the public loans,
will be found to be, “that a capital of more than
<span class="smcapuc">TWENTY MILLIONS</span> has been a needless addition
to the public debt, for which no money, or any
sort of equivalent has been received; and which
might have been avoided, together with a great
expence of interest, by only forming differently
the schemes of the public loans.”</p>

<p class="tb">The intention of the first section of the <span class="smcap">Third
Part</span> is to give, in as short a compass as possible,
a view of the progress of our <i>foreign trade</i>, and its
effect on the nation, from the beginning of this
century; and, particularly, to point out an unfavourable
change which seems to have taken place
since 1764.</p>

<p>In the second section of this part, an explanation
and analysis are given of all the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_xii" id="Page_2_xii">[xii]</a></span>
articles of the national debt, which will probably
inform every person of most that he can wish to
know concerning them.—I have added a general
account of the debts and resources of <span class="smcap">France</span>.
This is a subject at present particularly interesting
to this country; and, having been informed of
some important facts relating to it, I have
thought proper to lay them before the public,
with such reflexions as have offered themselves in
mentioning them.</p>

<p>The last section contains such of the calculations
in the <span class="smcap">Appendix</span> to the <i>Observations on
Civil Liberty</i> as were necessary to be reprinted, in
order to introduce the remarks I have added on
some particulars in the state of the <i>public income
and expenditure</i>, published not long ago by the
<i>Earl of Stair</i>. I have also meant to accommodate
the purchasers of the different editions of the
<i>Observations on Civil Liberty</i>, who will be enabled,
by this section, to possess themselves of all the
material alterations and improvements which were
made in that pamphlet after its first publication.—The
accounts, in the latter part of this tract, are so
various and extensive, that it is scarcely possible
there should not be some incorrectnesses in them.
But the pains I have taken, and the means of information
which I have possessed have been such,
that I cannot suspect that I have fallen into any
mistakes of consequence. Should, however, any
such have escaped me, it will be kind in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_xiii" id="Page_2_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
person to point them out with candour; and to
assist in making those accounts so correct and
perfect, as that they may serve for a basis to all
future accounts of the same kind.</p>

<p class="tb hanging">The following note in Mr. <i>Hume</i>’s History of
<i>England</i> was written by him a little before
his death, and left with other additions to be
inserted in the new edition of that history
just published. It contains, therefore, a kind
of dying warning from Mr. <i>Hume</i> to this kingdom;
and I have thought proper to transcribe
it, and to insert it in this place, as a confirmation
of similar sentiments frequently expressed
in these tracts.</p>

<p class="tb">“The supplies granted Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, during
a reign of <span class="smcapuc">FORTY-FIVE YEARS</span>, amounted
to three millions. The minister, in the war
which begun in 1754, was, in some periods,
allowed to lavish a sum equal to this in <span class="smcapuc">TWO
MONTHS</span>. The extreme frivolous object of
the late war, and the great importance of hers,
set this matter in still a stronger light. Money
too was in most particulars of the same value
in both periods: she paid eight-pence a day
to every foot soldier;—but our <span class="smcapuc">LATE DELUSIONS</span>
have much exceeded any thing known
in history, not even excepting those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_xiv" id="Page_2_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
Crusades. For, I suppose, there is no mathematical,
still less an arithmetical demonstration,
that the road to the holy land was not the road
to Paradise; as there is, that the endless increase
of national debt is the direct road to
national ruin. But having now completely
reached that goal, it is needless at present to
reflect on the past. It will be found in the
present year (1776) that all the revenues of
this island, north of the <i>Trent</i>, and west of
<i>Reading</i>, are mortgaged or anticipated for
ever. Could the small remainder be in a
worse condition, were these provinces seized
by <i>Austria</i> and <i>Prussia</i>? There is only this
difference, that some event might happen in
<i>Europe</i>, which would oblige those great monarchs
to disgorge their acquisitions. But no
imagination can figure a situation which will
induce our creditors to relinquish their claims,
or the public to seize their revenues.—So
egregious, indeed, has been our folly, that
we have even lost all title to compassion, under
the numberless calamities that are waiting
us.”—Mr. <i>Hume</i>’s History, vol. 5th, page
475.</p>

and <span class="smcap">Free Government</span>.</span></h2>

<h3 id="II_PART_I_SECT_I">SECT. I.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Nature of Civil Liberty, and the Essentials
of a Free Government.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">With respect to Liberty in general there
are two questions to be considered:</p>

<p>First, What it is?—And Secondly,
How far it is of value?</p>

<p>There is no difficulty in answering the first of
these questions.—To be <span class="smcap">Free</span>, is “to be able to
act or to forbear acting, as we think best;” or
“to be masters of our own resolutions and conduct.”—It
may be pretended, that it is not
desirable to be thus free; but, without doubt,
this it is to be <i>free</i>; and this is what all mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_2" id="Page_2_2">[2]</a></span>
when they say of themselves or others that they
are <i>free</i>.</p>

<p>I have observed, that all the different kinds of
Liberty run up into the general idea of self-government<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.—The
Liberty of men as <i>agents</i>
is that power of self-determination which all
agents, as such, possess.—Their Liberty as <i>moral</i>
agents is their power of self-government in their
<i>moral</i> conduct.—Their Liberty as <i>religious</i> agents
is their power of self-government in <i>religion</i>.—And
their Liberty, as members of communities associated
for the purposes of civil government, is
their power of self-government in all their civil
concerns. It is Liberty, in the last of these views
of it, that is the subject of my present enquiry;
and it may, in other words, be defined to be
“the power of a state to govern itself by its own
will.”—In order, therefore, to determine
whether a state is free, no more is necessary than
to determine whether there is any will, different
from its own, to which it is subject.</p>

<p>When we speak of a state, we mean the <i>whole</i>
state, and not any <i>part</i> of it; and the will of the
state, therefore, is the will of the whole.—There
are two ways in which this will may be
expressed. First, by the suffrages of all the members
given in person. Or secondly, by the suffrages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_3" id="Page_2_3">[3]</a></span>
of a body of Representatives, in appointing
whom all the members have voices.—A state
governed by its own will in the first of these ways
enjoys the most complete and perfect Liberty;
but such a government being impracticable, except
in very small states, it is necessary that civil
communities in general should satisfy themselves
with that degree of Liberty which can be obtained
in the last of these ways; and Liberty so obtained
may be sufficiently ample, and at the same time
is capable of being extended to the largest
states<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</p>

<p class="tb">But here, before I proceed, I must desire, that
an observation may be attended to, which appears
to me of considerable consequence.—A distinction
should be made between the <i>Liberty</i> of a
state, and its not suffering oppression; or between
a free government, and a government under which
freedom is enjoyed. Under the most despotic government
liberty may happen to be enjoyed. But
being derived from a will over which the state
has no controul, and not from its own will; or
from an accidental mildness in the <i>administration</i>,
and not from a <i>constitution</i> of government; it is
nothing but an indulgence of a precarious nature,
and of little importance.—Individuals in private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_4" id="Page_2_4">[4]</a></span>
life, while held under the power of masters,
cannot be denominated free, however equitably
and kindly they may be treated. This is strictly
true of <i>communities</i> as well as of <i>individuals</i>.—Civil
Liberty (it should be remembered) must be
enjoyed as a right derived from the Author of
nature only, or it cannot be the blessing which
merits this name. If there is any human power
which is considered as <i>giving</i> it, on which it depends,
and which can invade or recall it at pleasure,
it changes its nature, and becomes a species
of slavery.</p>

<p class="tb">But to return—The force superseding self-government
in a state, or the power destroying
its Liberty, is of two kinds. It may be either a
power <i>without</i> itself, or a power <i>within</i> itself.
The former constitutes what may be properly
called <i>external</i>, and the latter <i>internal</i> slavery.—Were
there any distant state which had acquired a
sovereignty over this country, and exercised the
power of making its laws and disposing its property,
we should be in the first kind of slavery;
and, if not totally depraved by a habit of subjection
to such a power, we should think ourselves in a
miserable condition; and an advocate for such a
power would be considered as insulting us, who
should attempt to reconcile us to it by telling us,
that we were <i>one</i> community with that distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_5" id="Page_2_5">[5]</a></span>
state, though destitute of a single voice in its legislature;
and, on this ground, should maintain,
that all resistance to it was no less criminal than
any resistance <i>within</i> a state to the authority of
that state.—In short, every state, not incorporated
with another by an equal representation, and yet
subject to its dominion, is enslaved in this sense.—Such
was the slavery of the provinces subject to
antient <i>Rome</i>; and such is the slavery of every
community, as far as any other community is
master of it; or as far as, in respect of taxation
and internal legislation, it is not independent of
every other community. Nor does it make any
difference to such a community, that it enjoys
within itself a free constitution of government, if
that constitution is itself liable to be altered, suspended
or over-ruled at the discretion of the state
which possesses the sovereignty over it.</p>

<p>But the slavery most prevalent in the world has
been internal slavery.—In order better to explain
this, it is proper to observe, that all civil government
being either the government of a <i>whole</i>
by <i>itself</i>, or of a <i>whole</i> by a <i>power extraneous</i> to
it, or of a <i>whole</i> by a <i>part</i>; the first <i>alone</i> is <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>,
and the two last are <span class="smcap">Tyranny</span>, producing
the two sorts of slavery which I have mentioned.
Internal slavery, therefore, takes place
wherever a whole community is governed by a
<i>part</i>; and this, perhaps, is the most concise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_6" id="Page_2_6">[6]</a></span>
comprehensive account that can be given of it.—The
part that governs may be either a <i>single</i> man,
as in <i>absolute Monarchies</i>; or, a body of grandees,
as in <i>Aristocracies</i>. In both these cases the
powers of government are commonly held for
life without delegation, and descend from father
to son; and the people governed are in the same
situation with cattle upon an estate, which descends
by inheritance from one owner to another.—But
farther. A community may be governed by
a body of delegates, and yet be enslaved.—Though
government by representation alone is
free, unless when carried on by the personal suffrages
of all the members of a state, yet <i>all</i> such
government is by no means free. In order to
render it so, the following requisites are necessary.</p>

<p>First, The representation must be <i>complete</i>. No
state, a <i>part</i> of which only is represented in the
Legislature that governs it, is <i>self</i>-governed.
Had <i>Scotland</i> no representatives in the Parliament
of <i>Britain</i>, it would not be free; nor would it be
proper to call <i>Britain</i> free, though <i>England</i>, its
other part, were adequately represented. The
like is true, in general, of every country subject to
a Legislature in which <i>some</i> of its parts, or some
classes of men in it, are represented, and others
not.</p>

<p>Secondly, The representatives of a free state
must be <i>freely</i> chosen. If this is not the case, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_7" id="Page_2_7">[7]</a></span>
are not at all representatives; and government by
them degenerates into government by a junto of
men in the community, who happen to have
power or wealth enough to command or purchase
their offices.</p>

<p>Thirdly, After being <i>freely</i> chosen, they must
be themselves <i>free</i>. If there is any higher will
which directs their resolutions, and on which
they are dependent, they become the instruments
of that will; and it is that will alone that in
reality governs the state.</p>

<p>Fourthly, They must be chosen for short
terms; and, in all their acts, be accountable to
their constituents. Without this a people will
have no controul over their representatives; and,
in chusing them, they will give up entirely their
Liberty; and only enjoy the poor privilege of
naming, at certain intervals, a set of men whom
they are to <i>serve</i>, and who are to dispose, at
their discretion, of their property and lives.</p>

<p class="tb">The causes of internal slavery now mentioned
prevail, some of them more and others less, in different
communities. With respect, in particular,
to a government by representation; it is evident,
that it deviates more or less from Liberty, in proportion
as the representation is more or less imperfect.
And, if imperfect in every one of the
instances I have recited; that is, if inadequate
and partial; subject to no controul from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_8" id="Page_2_8">[8]</a></span>
people; corruptly chosen for long terms; and,
after being chosen, venal and dependent;—in
these circumstances, a representation becomes an
imposition and a nusance; and government by it
is as inconsistent with true Liberty as the most
arbitrary and despotic government.</p>

<p class="tb">I have been so much misunderstood<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> on this
subject, that it is necessary I should particularly
observe here, that my intention in this account
has been merely to shew what is requisite to constitute
a state or a government free, and not at
all to define the best form of government. These
are two very different points. The first is attended
with few difficulties. A free state is
a state self-governed in the manner I have described.
But it may be free, and yet not
enjoy the best constitution of government. Liberty,
though the most essential requisite in government,
is not the only one. Wisdom, union,
dispatch, secresy, and vigour are likewise requisite;
and that is the best form of government
which best unites all these qualities; or which,
to an equal and perfect Liberty, adds the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_9" id="Page_2_9">[9]</a></span>
wisdom in deliberating and resolving, and the greatest
union, force and expedition in executing<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.</p>

<p>In short, my whole meaning is, that the will of
the Community alone ought to govern; but that
there are different methods of obtaining and executing
this will; of which those are the best which
collect into it most of the knowledge and experience
of the community, and at the same time
carry it into execution with most dispatch and
vigour.</p>

<p>It has been the employment of the wisest men in
all ages to contrive plans for this purpose; and the
happiness of society depends so much on civil
government, that it is not possible the human understanding
should be better employed.</p>

<p class="tb">I have said in the Observations on Civil Liberty,
that “in a free state every man is his own legislator.”—I
have been happy in since finding
the<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> same assertion in <i>Montesquieu</i>, and also in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_10" id="Page_2_10">[10]</a></span>
Mr. Justice <i>Blackstone</i>’s Commentaries. It expresses
the fundamental principle of our constitution;
and the meaning of it is plainly, that
every independent agent in a free state ought to
have a share in the government of it, either by
himself <i>personally</i>, or by a body of representatives,
in chusing whom he has a free vote, and therefore
all the concern and weight which are
possible, and consistent with the equal rights
of every other member of the state.—But
though the meaning of this assertion is so obvious,
and the truth of it undeniable, it has
been much exclaimed against, and occasioned no
small part of the opposition which has been
made to the principles advanced in the <i>Observations
on Civil Liberty</i>.—One even of the most
candid, as well as the ablest of my opponents,
(whose difference of opinion from me I sincerely
lament) has intimated, that it implies, that, in
a free state,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> <i>thieves and pick-pockets have a
right to make laws for themselves</i>.—The public
will not, I hope, wonder that I chuse to take
little notice of such objections.</p>

<p class="tb">It has been said, that the liberty for which I
have pleaded, is “a right or power in every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_11" id="Page_2_11">[11]</a></span>
to act as he likes without any restraint.”—However
unfairly this representation has been
given of my account of liberty, I am ready to
adopt it, provided it is understood with a few
limitations.—<span class="smcap">Moral Liberty</span>, in particular,
cannot be better defined than by calling it “a
power in every one to do as he likes.” My
opponents in general seem to be greatly puzzled
with this; and I am afraid it will signify little to
attempt explaining it to them by saying, that
every man’s will, if perfectly free from restraint,
would carry him invariably to rectitude and
virtue; and that no one who acts wickedly acts
as he <i>likes</i>, but is conscious of a tyranny within
him overpowering his judgment, and carrying
him into a conduct, for which he condemns and
hates himself. <i>The things that he would he does
not</i>;<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> <i>and the things that he would not, those he
does</i>. He is, therefore, a slave in the properest
sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Religious Liberty</span>, likewise, is a power of
acting as we <i>like</i> in religion; or of professing and
practising that mode of religious worship which we
think most acceptable to the Deity.—But here
the limitation to which I have referred must be
attended to. <span class="smcap">All</span> have the same unalienable right
to this Liberty; and consequently, no one has a
right to such a use of it as shall take it from others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_12" id="Page_2_12">[12]</a></span>
Within this limit, or as far as he does not encroach
on the equal liberty of others, every one
has a right to do as he pleases in religion.—That
the right to religious Liberty goes as far as
this every one must allow, who is not a friend to
persecution; and that it cannot go farther, is
self-evident; for if it did, there would be a contradiction
in the natures of things; and it would
be true, that every one had a right to enjoy
what every one had a right to destroy.—If,
therefore, the religious faith of any person leads
him to hurt another because he professes a different
faith; or if it carries him, in any instances, to intolerance,
Liberty itself requires he should be restrained,
and that, in such instances, he should lose
his liberty.</p>

<p>All this is equally applicable to the Liberty of
man in his <i>civil</i> capacity; and it is a maxim true
universally, “that as far as any one does not
molest <i>others</i>, others ought not to molest <i>him</i>.”—All
have a right to the free and undisturbed
possession of their good names, properties and
lives; and it is the right all have to this that
gives the right to establish civil government,
which is or ought to be nothing but an institution
(by laws and provisions made with <i>common</i> consent)
for guarding this right against invasion; for giving
to every one, in <i>temporals</i> and <i>spirituals</i>, the
power of commanding his own conduct; or, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_13" id="Page_2_13">[13]</a></span>
acting as he pleases, and going where he will,
provided he does not run foul of others.—Just
government, therefore, does not <i>infringe</i> liberty,
but <i>establish</i> it.—It does not <i>take away</i> the rights
of mankind, but <i>protect</i> and <i>confirm</i> them.—I
will add, that it does not even create any new
subordinations of particular men to one another,
but only gives security in those several stations,
whether of authority and pre-eminence, or of subordination
and dependence, which nature has established,
and which must have arisen among mankind
whether civil government had been instituted
or not. But this goes beyond my purpose
in this place, and more will be said of it presently.</p>

<p class="tb">To sum up the whole—Our ideas of Civil Liberty
will be rendered more distinct by considering
it under the three following views:—The Liberty
of the <i>citizen</i>—The liberty of the <i>government</i>—And
the liberty of the <i>community</i>.—A <i>citizen</i> is
free when the power of commanding his own
conduct and the quiet possession of his life, person,
property and good name are <i>secured</i> to him
by being his own legislator in the sense explained
in <a href="#Page_2_10">page 10</a><a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.—A <i>government</i> is free when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_14" id="Page_2_14">[14]</a></span>
constituted in such a manner as to give this <i>security</i>.—And
the freedom of a community or
nation is the same among nations, that the freedom
of a citizen is among his fellow-citizens.—It is
not, therefore, as observed in <a href="#Page_2_3">page 3</a>, the mere
possession of Liberty that denominates a citizen
or a community free; but that <i>security</i> for the
possession of it which arises from such a free government
as I have described; and which takes
place, when there exists no power that can take it
away.—It is in the same sense that the mere
performance of virtuous actions is not what denominates
an agent virtuous; but the temper and
habits from whence they spring; or that <i>inward
constitution</i>, and right balance of the affections,
which <i>secure</i> the practice of virtue, produce stability
of conduct, and constitute a <i>character</i>.</p>

<p>I cannot imagine how it can be disputed whether
this is a just account of the nature of Liberty.
It has been already given more briefly
in the Observations on Civil Liberty; and it is
with reluctance I have repeated so much of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_15" id="Page_2_15">[15]</a></span>
has been there said. But the wrong apprehensions
which have been entertained of my sentiments
have rendered this necessary. And, for the same
reason, I am obliged to go on to the subject of the
next section.</p>

<h3 id="II_PART_I_SECT_II">SECT. II.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the <span class="smcap">Value</span> of Liberty, and the <span class="smcap">Excellence</span>
of a Free Government.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Having shewn in the preceding section
“what Liberty is;” the next question to
be considered is, “how far it is valuable.”</p>

<p>Nothing need be said to shew the value of the
three kinds of liberty which I have distinguished
under the names of <i>Physical</i>, <i>Moral</i>, and <i>Religious</i>
Liberty. They are, without doubt, the foundation
of all the happiness and dignity of men, as
reasonable and moral agents, and the subjects of
the Deity.—It is, in like manner, true of <i>Civil</i>
Liberty, that it is the foundation of the whole
happiness and dignity of men as members of civil
society, and the subjects of civil government.</p>

<p>First. It is Civil Liberty, or such free government
as I have described, that alone can give just
security against oppression. One government is
better than another in proportion as it gives more
of this security. It is, on this account, that the
supreme government of the Deity is perfect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_16" id="Page_2_16">[16]</a></span>
There is not a possibility of being oppressed or
aggrieved by it. Subjection to it is the same
with complete freedom.</p>

<p>Were there any men on whose superior wisdom
and goodness we might absolutely depend, they
could not possess too much power; and the love
of liberty itself would engage us to fly to them,
and to put ourselves under their direction. But
such are the principles that govern human nature;
such the weakness and folly of men; such their
love of domination, selfishness, and depravity;
that none of them can be raised to an elevation
above others without the utmost danger. The
constant experience of the world has verified this;
and proved, that nothing intoxicates the human
mind so much as power, and that men, when
they have got possession of it, have seldom failed
to employ it in grinding their fellow-men, and
gratifying the vilest passions.—In the establishment,
therefore, of civil government, it would
be preposterous to rely on the discretion of any
men. If a people would obtain security against
oppression, they must seek it in <i>themselves</i>, and
never part with the powers of government out <i>of
their own</i> hands. It is there only they can be safe.—A
people will never oppress themselves, or invade
their own rights. But if they trust the arbitrary
will of any body or succession of men, they trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_17" id="Page_2_17">[17]</a></span>
<span class="smcapuc">ENEMIES</span>, and it may be depended on that the
worst evils will follow.</p>

<p class="tb">It follows from hence, that a free government
is the only government which is consistent with
the ends of government.—Men combine into
communities and institute government to obtain
the peaceable enjoyment of their rights, and to
defend themselves against injustice and violence:
And when they endeavour to secure these ends by
such a free government as I have described, improved
by such arrangements as may have a tendency
to preserve it from confusion, and to concentrate
in it as much as possible of the wisdom
and force of the community; In this case, it is a
most rational and important institution.—But
when the contrary is done; and the benefits of
government are sought by establishing a government
of <i>men</i>, and not of <i>laws</i> made with common
consent; it becomes a most absurd institution.—It
is seeking a remedy for oppression in <i>one</i> quarter,
by establishing it in <i>another</i>; and avoiding the
outrages of <i>little</i> plunderers, by constituting a
set of <i>great</i> plunderers.—It is, in short, the
folly of <i>giving up</i> liberty in order to <i>maintain</i>
Liberty; and, in the very act of endeavouring to
secure the most valuable rights, to arm a body of
enemies with power to destroy them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_18" id="Page_2_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>I can easily believe, that mankind, in the first
and rude state of society, might act thus irrationally.
Absolute governments, being the simplest
forms of government, might be the first that
were established. A people having experienced
the happy effects of the wisdom or the valour of
particular men, might be led to trust them with
unlimited power as their rulers and legislators.
But they would soon find reason to repent: And
the time, I hope, may come, when mankind in
general, taught by long and dear experience, and
<i>weary</i> of the abuses of power under <i>slavish</i> governments,
will learn to detest them, and never to give
up that <span class="smcap">Self-Government</span>, which, whether we
consider men in their private or collective capacities,
is the first of all the blessings they can possess.</p>

<p class="tb">Again. Free governments are the only governments
which give scope to the exertion of
the powers of men, and are favourable to their
improvement.—The members of free states,
knowing their rights to be secure, and that they
shall enjoy without molestation the fruits of every
acquisition they can make, are encouraged and
incited to industry. Being at liberty to push their
researches as far as they can into all subjects, and
to guide themselves by their own judgments in all
their religious and civil concerns, while they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_19" id="Page_2_19">[19]</a></span>
allow others to do the same; error and superstition
must lose ground. Conscious of being their own
governors, bound to obey no laws except such as
they have given their consent to, and subject to no
controul from the arbitrary will of any of their
fellow-citizens; they possess an elevation and
force of mind which must make them great and
happy.—How different is the situation of the
vassals of despotic power?—Like cattle inured
to the yoke, they are driven on in one track, afraid
of speaking or even thinking on the most interesting
points; looking up continually to a poor
creature who is their master; their powers fettered;
and some of the noblest springs of action in human
nature rendered useless within them. There is
nothing indeed more humiliating than that debasement
of mankind which takes place in such
situations.</p>

<p>It has been observed of free governments, that
they are often torn by violent contests, which
render them dreadful scenes of distress and anarchy.
But it ought to be considered, that this has not
been owing to the <i>nature</i> of such governments;
but to their having been ill-modelled, and wanted
those arrangements and supplemental checks
which are necessary to constitute a wise form of
government.—There is no reason to doubt, but
that free governments may be so contrived, as to
exclude the greatest part of the struggles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_20" id="Page_2_20">[20]</a></span>
tumults which have arisen in free states; and, as
far as they cannot be excluded, they will do more
good than harm. They will occasion the display
of powers, and produce exertions which can never
be seen in the <i>still</i> scenes of life. They are the
active efforts of health and vigour; and always
tend to preserve and purify. Whereas, on the
contrary, the <i>quiet</i> which prevails under slavish
governments, and which may seem to be a recommendation
of them, proceeds from an ignominious
tameness, and stagnation of the human faculties.
It is the same with the <i>stillness</i> of midnight, or
the <i>silence</i> and torpor of death.</p>

<p class="tb">Further. Free governments are the only governments
which are consistent with the natural
equality of mankind. This is a principle which,
in my opinion, has been assumed, with the greatest
reason, by some of the best writers on government.
But the meaning of it is not, that all the subordinations
in human life owe their existence to the
institution of civil government. The superiorities
and distinctions arising from the relation of parents
to their children; from the differences in the personal
qualities and abilities of men; and from
servitudes founded on voluntary compacts, must
have existed in a state of nature, and would now
take place were all men so virtuous as to leave no
occasion for civil government.—The maxim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_21" id="Page_2_21">[21]</a></span>
therefore, “that all men are naturally equal,” refers
to their state when grown up to maturity, and
become independent agents, capable of acquiring
property, and of directing their own conduct.
And the sense of it is, that no one of them is constituted
by the author of nature the vassal or
subject of another, or has any right to give law to
him, or, without his consent, to take away any
part of his property, or to abridge him of his
liberty.—In a state of nature, one man may
have received benefits from another; and this
would lay the person obliged under an obligation
of gratitude, but it would not make his <i>benefactor</i>
his <i>master</i>; or give him a right to judge for him
what grateful returns he ought to make, and to
extort these from him.—In a state of nature,
also, one man may possess more strength, or more
knowledge, or more property than another; and
this would give him weight and influence; but it
would not give him any degree of authority.
There would not be one human being who would
be bound to <i>obey</i> him.—A person likewise, in a
state of nature, might let out his labour, or give
up to another, on certain stipulated terms, the
direction of his conduct; and this would so far
bring him into the station of a <i>servant</i>; but being
done by himself, and on such terms only as he
chuses to consent to, it is an <i>instance</i> of his liberty;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_22" id="Page_2_22">[22]</a></span>
and he will always have it in his power to quit
the service he has chosen, or to enter into another.</p>

<p>This equality or independence of men is one of
their essential rights.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> It is the same with that
equality or independence which now actually takes
place among the different states or kingdoms of
the world with respect to one another. Mankind
came with this right from the hands of their
Maker.—But all governments, which are not
free, are totally inconsistent with it. They imply,
that there are some of mankind who are born
with an inherent right of dominion; and that the
rest are born under an obligation to subjection;
and that civil government, instead of being founded
on any compact, is nothing but the exercise of this
right. Some such sentiments seem to be now reviving
in this country, and even to be growing
fashionable. Most of the writers against the <i>Observations
on Civil Liberty</i> argue on the supposition
of a right in the <i>few</i> to govern the <i>many</i><a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, independently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_23" id="Page_2_23">[23]</a></span>
of their own choice. Some of these
writers have gone so far as to assert, in plain language,
that civil governors derive their power
immediately from the Deity; and are <i>his</i> agents
or representatives, accountable to him only. And
one courtly writer, in particular, has honoured
them with the appellation of <span class="smcap">our political Gods</span>.—Probably,
this is the idea of civil governors
entertained by the author of the <i>Remarks on the
Acts of the Thirteenth Parliament of Great Britain</i>:
for it is not easy to imagine on what other ground
he can assert, that <i>property</i> and <i>civil rights</i> are derived
from civil governors, and their <i>gifts</i> to mankind<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_24" id="Page_2_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>If these sentiments are just, civil governors are
indeed an awful order of beings; and it becomes
us to enquire with anxiety who they are, and how
we may distinguish them from the rest of mankind.—Shall
we take for such all, whether <i>men</i>
or <i>women</i>, whom we find in actual possession of
civil power, whatever may be their characters; or
however they may have acquired their power?—This
is too extravagant to be asserted. It would
legalize the <i>American</i> Congress.—There must
then be some <i>pretenders</i> among civil governors;
and it is necessary we should know how to discover
them. It is incredible, that the Deity should not
have made this easy to us, by some particular
marks and distinctions, which point out to our
notice his <i>real</i> vicegerents; just as he has pointed
out man, by his figure and superior powers, to be
the governor of the lower creatures.—In particular;
these persons must be possessed of wisdom
and goodness superior to those of the rest of mankind<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>;
for, without this, a grant of the powers
they are supposed to possess would be nothing but
a grant of power to injure and oppress, without
remedy and without bounds. But this is a test
by which they cannot be tryed. It would leave
but few of them in possession of the places they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_25" id="Page_2_25">[25]</a></span>
hold and the rights they claim. It is not in the
high ranks of life, or among the great and
mighty, that we are to seek wisdom and goodness.
These love the shade, and fly from observation.
They are to be found chiefly in the middle ranks
of life, and among the contemplative and philosophical,
who decline public employments, and
look down with pity on the scramble for power
among mankind, and the restlessness and misery
of ambition.—It is proper to add, that it has
never been hitherto understood that any superiority
in intellectual and moral qualifications lays
the foundation of a claim to <i>dominion</i>.</p>

<p>It is not then, by their superior endowments,
that the Deity intended to point out to us the
<i>few</i> whom he has destined to command the <i>many</i>.—But
in what other manner could they be distinguished?—Must
we embrace <i>Sir Robert Filmer</i>’s
<i>Patriarchal</i> scheme? One would have thought,
that Mr. <i>Locke</i> has said more than enough to
expose this stupid scheme. One of my opponents,
however, has adopted it; and the necessary inference
from it is that, as there is but now one
lineal descendent from Adam’s eldest son, there
can be but one rightful monarch of the world.—But
I will not abuse my reader’s patience by
saying more on this subject. I am sorry that
in this country there should be any occasion for
taking notice of principles so absurd, and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_26" id="Page_2_26">[26]</a></span>
same time so pernicious<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. I say, <span class="smcapuc">PERNICIOUS</span>;
for they imply, that King <i>James</i> the Second was
deposed at the Revolution unlawfully and impiously;
that the present King is an usurper; and
that the present government, being derived from
rebellion and treason, has no right to our allegiance.</p>

<p>Without all doubt, it is the choice of the
people that makes civil governors.—The people
are the spring of all civil power, and they have
a right to modify it as they please.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_27" id="Page_2_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Mankind being naturally equal according to
the foregoing explanation, civil government, <i>in
its genuine intention</i>, is an institution for maintaining
that equality, by defending it against the encroachments
of violence and tyranny. All the
subordinations and distinctions in society previous
to its establishment, it leaves as it found them,
only confirming and protecting them. It makes
no man <i>master</i> of another. It elevates no person
above his fellow citizens. On the contrary, it
levels all by fixing all in a state of subjection to
one common authority.—The authority of the
laws.—The will of the community.—<span class="smcap">Taxes</span>
are <i>given</i>; not <i>imposed</i>. LAWS are regulations
of common choice; not injunctions of superior
power.—The authority of magistrates is the
authority of the State; and their salaries are wages
paid by the State for executing its will and doing
its business. <i>They</i> do not govern the <i>State</i>. It
is the <i>State</i> governs <i>them</i>; and had they just
ideas of their own stations, they would consider
themselves as no less properly <i>servants</i> of the
Public, than the labourers who work upon its
roads, or the soldiers who fight its battles.—A
<span class="smcap">King</span>, in particular, is only the first executive
officer; the creature of the law; and as much
accountable and subject to the law as the meanest
peasant<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. And were Kings properly attentive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_28" id="Page_2_28">[28]</a></span>
to their duty, and as anxious as they should be
about performing it, they could not easily avoid
sinking under the weight of their charge.</p>

<p class="tb">The account now given is, I am fully persuaded,
in every particular, a true account of
what civil government <i>ought</i> to be; and it
teaches us plainly the great importance and excellence
of <span class="smcapuc">FREE</span> Government.—It is this only
that answers the description I have given of government;
that secures against oppression; that gives
room for that elevation of spirit and that exertion
of the human powers which is necessary to human
improvement; or that is consistent with the ends of
government, with the rights of mankind, and their
natural equality and independence. <i>Free</i> Government,
therefore, only, is <i>just</i> and <i>legitimate</i>
government.</p>

<p>It follows farther from the preceding account,
that no people can lawfully surrender or cede
their Liberty. This must appear to any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_29" id="Page_2_29">[29]</a></span>
who will consider, that when a people make such
a cession, and the extensive powers of government
are trusted to the discretion of any man or body
of men, they part with the powers of life and
death, and give themselves up a prey to oppression;
that they make themselves the instrument
of any injustice in which their rulers may chuse
to employ them, by arming them against neighbouring
states; and also, that they do this not
only for <i>themselves</i>, but for their <i>posterity</i>.—I will
add, that if such a cession has been made; or if
through any causes, a people have lost their Liberty,
they must have a right to emancipate
themselves as soon as they can<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. In attempting
this, indeed, they ought to consider the sufferings
which may attend the struggle, and the evils
which may arise from a defeat. But at the same
time, it will be proper to consider, that the
sufferings attending such a struggle must be temporary,
whereas the evils to be avoided are permanent;
and that Liberty is a blessing so inestimable,
“that whenever there appears any probability
of recovering it, a people should be
willing to run many hazards, and even not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_30" id="Page_2_30">[30]</a></span>
repine at the greatest expence of blood or treasure.”<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p class="tb">I am very sensible, that civil government, as it
actually exists in the world, by no means answers
to the account I have given of it.—Instead of
being an institution for guarding the weak against
the strong, we find it an institution which makes
the strong yet stronger, and gives them a systematical
power of oppressing. Instead of promoting
virtue and restraining vice, encouraging free
enquiry, establishing Liberty, and protecting alike
all peaceable persons in the enjoyment of their
civil and religious rights; we see a savage despotism,
under its name, laying waste the earth, unreasonably
elevating some and depressing others,
discouraging improvement, and trampling upon
every human right. That force of states, which
ought to be applied only to their own defence,
we see continually applied to the purpose of attack,
and used to extend dominion by conquering
neighbouring communities.—Civil governors
consider not themselves <i>servants</i> but as <i>masters</i>.
Their stations they think they hold in their own
right. The people they reckon their property;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_31" id="Page_2_31">[31]</a></span>
and their possessions, a common <i>stock</i> from which
they have a right to take what<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> they will, and
of which no more belongs to any individual than
they are pleased to <i>leave</i> him.</p>

<p>What a miserable perversion is this of a most
important institution? What a grievance is government
so degenerated?—But this perversion
furnishes no just argument against the truth of the
account I have given. Similar degeneracies have
prevailed in other instances of no less importance.</p>

<p>Reason in man, like the will of the community
in the political world, was intended to give law
to his whole conduct, and to be the supreme controuling
power within him. The passions are
subordinate powers, or an <i>executive force</i> under
the direction of reason, kindly given to be, as it
were, wind and tide to the vessel of life in its
course through this world to future honour and
felicity.—How different from this is the <i>actual</i>
state of man?—Those powers which were destined
to <i>govern</i> are made to <i>serve</i>; and those
powers which were destined to <i>serve</i>, are allowed
to <i>govern</i>. Passion guides human life; and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_32" id="Page_2_32">[32]</a></span>
men make no other use of their reason than to
justify whatever their interest or their inclinations
determine them to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Religion</span> likewise (the perfection of <span class="smcap">Reason</span>)
is, in its true nature, the inspirer of humanity and
joy, and the spring of all that can be great and
worthy in a character; and were we to see its genuine
effects among mankind, we should see nothing
but peace and hope and justice and kindness,
founded on that regard to God and to his
will, which is the noblest principle of action.—But
how different an aspect does religion actually
wear? What is it, too generally, in the practice
of mankind, but a gloomy and cruel superstition,
rendering them severe and sour; teaching them
to compound for wickedness by punctuality in
religious forms; and prompting them to harrass,
persecute and exterminate one another?</p>

<p>The same perversion has taken place still more
remarkably in <span class="smcap">Christianity</span>; the perfection of
<span class="smcap">Religion</span>.—<span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> has established among
Christians absolute equality. He has declared,
that they have but <i>one</i> master, even himself; and
that they are all <i>brethren</i>; and, therefore, has
commanded them not to be called <i>masters</i>; and,
instead of assuming authority over one another,
to be ready to <i>wash one another’s feet</i><a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_33" id="Page_2_33">[33]</a></span>
princes of the Gentiles, he says, exercise lordship
over them, and are flattered with<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> high
titles; but he has ordained, that it shall not be
so amongst his followers; and that if any one of
them would be <i>chief</i>, he must be the <i>servant</i> of
all.—The clergy in his church are, by his appointment,
no more than a body of men, chosen
by the different societies of Christians, to conduct
their worship, and to promote their spiritual improvement,
without any other powers than those
of persuasion and instruction. It is expressly directed,
that they shall not make themselves
Lords of <i>God’s heritage</i>, or exercise dominion
over the faith of Christians, but be <i>helpers
of their joy</i><a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.—Who can, without astonishment,
compare these appointments of Christianity,
with the events which have happened in
the Christian church?—That religion which
thus inculcates humility and forbids all domination,
and the end of which was to produce <i>peace
an earth, and good-will among men</i>, has been turned
into an occasion of animosities the most dreadful,
and of ambition the most destructive. Notwithstanding
its mildness and benignity, and the tendency
it has to extinguish in the human breast
pride and malevolence; it has been the means of
arming the spirits of men with unrelenting fury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_34" id="Page_2_34">[34]</a></span>
against one another. Instead of <i>peace</i>, it has
brought a <i>sword</i>; and its professors, instead of
washing one another’s feet, have endeavoured to
tread on one another’s necks.—The ministers,
in particular, of Christianity, became, soon after
its establishment, an independent body of spiritual
rulers, nominating one another in perpetual succession;
claiming, by divine right, the highest
powers; and forming a <span class="smcap">Hierarchy</span>, which by
degrees produced a despotism more extravagant
than any that ever before existed on this earth.</p>

<p>A considerate person must find difficulties in
enquiring into the causes and reasons of that
depravity of human nature which has produced
these evils, and rendered the best institutions
liable to be so corrupted. This enquiry is
much the same with the enquiry into the origin
of moral evil, which has in all ages puzzled
human wisdom. I have at present nothing to do
with it. It is enough for my purpose in these
observations, that the facts I have mentioned
prove undeniably, that the state of civil government
in the world affords no reason for concluding,
that I have not given a just account of its true
nature and origin.</p>

<p class="tb">I have shewn at the beginning of this section,
that it is free government alone that can preserve
from oppression, give security to the rights of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_35" id="Page_2_35">[35]</a></span>
people, and answer the ends of government. It
is necessary I should here observe, that I would
not be understood to mean, that there can be
no <i>kind</i> or <i>degree</i> of security for the rights of
a people, under any government which cannot be
denominated free. Even under an absolute Monarchy
or an Aristocracy, there may be laws and
customs which, having gained sacredness by time,
may restrain oppression, and afford some important
securities.—Under governments by representation,
there must be still greater checks on
oppression, provided the representation, though
partial, is uncorrupt, and also frequently changed.
In these circumstances, there may be so much of
a common interest between the body of representatives
and the people, and they may stand so
much on one ground, that there will be no temptations
to oppression.—The taxes which the representative
body impose, they will be obliged
themselves to pay; and the laws they make, they
will make with the prospect of soon returning to
the situation of those for whom they make them,
and of being themselves governed by them.</p>

<p>It seems particularly worth notice here, that
as far as there are any such checks under any
government, they are the consequence of its partaking
so far of Liberty, and that the security attending
them is more or less in proportion as a
government partakes more or less of Liberty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_36" id="Page_2_36">[36]</a></span>
If, under an absolute government, fundamental
laws and long established institutions give security
in any instances, it is because they are held so sacred
that a despot is afraid to violate them; or, in
other words, because a people, not being completely
subdued, have still some controul over
the government.—The like is more evidently
true under mixed governments of which a
house of representatives, fairly chosen and freely
deliberating and resolving, forms a part; and it is
one of the highest recommendations of such governments
that, even when the representation is
most imperfect, they have a tendency to give
more security than any other governments.—Under
other governments, it is the fear of exciting
insurrections by contradicting established
maxims, that restrains oppression. But, as, in
general, a people will bear much, and are seldom
driven to resistance till grievances become intolerable,
their rulers can venture far without danger;
and therefore, under such governments, are
very imperfectly restrained. On the contrary;
If there is an honest representation, vested with
powers like to those of our <i>House of Commons</i>, the
redress of grievances, as soon as they appear, will
be always easily attainable, and the rulers of a
state will be under a necessity of regarding the
first beginnings of discontent.—Such, and greater
than can be easily described, are the advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_37" id="Page_2_37">[37]</a></span>
of even an <i>imperfect representation</i> in a government.
How great then must be the blessing of a
<span class="smcap">complete Representation</span>?—<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> It is this
only gives full security; and that can properly
denominate a people free.</p>

<p class="tb">It deserves to be added here, that as there can
be no private character so abandoned as to want
<i>all</i> virtue; so there can be no government so slavish,
as to exclude <i>every</i> restraint upon oppression.—The
most slavish and, therefore, the
worst governments are those under which there is
nothing to set bounds to oppression, besides the
<i>discretion</i> and <i>humanity</i> of those who govern.—Of
this kind are the following governments.</p>

<p>First, All governments <i>purely</i> despotic. These
may be either monarchical, aristocratical. The
latter are the worst, agreeably to a common observation,
that it is better to have <i>one</i> master than
<i>many</i>. The appetites of a single despot may be
easily satiated; but this may be impossible where
there is a multitude.</p>

<p>Secondly, All provincial governments.—The
history of mankind proves these to be the worst of
all governments; and that no oppression is equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_38" id="Page_2_38">[38]</a></span>
to that which one people are capable of practising
towards another. I have mentioned some of the
reasons of this in the <i>Observations on Civil Liberty</i>,
Part I. sect. 3. Bodies of men do not feel for
one another as individuals do. The <i>odium</i> of a
cruel action, when shared among many, is not regarded.
The master of slaves working on a
plantation, though he may keep them down
to prevent their becoming strong enough to
emancipate themselves, yet is led by <i>interest</i>,
as well as <i>humanity</i>, to govern them with such
moderation, as to preserve their use: But these
causes will produce more of this good effect,
when the slaves are under the eye of their proprietor,
and form a part of his family, than when
they are settled on a distant plantation, where he
can know little of them, and is obliged to trust
them to the management of rapacious servants.</p>

<p>It is particularly observable here, that <i>free</i>
governments, though happier in themselves, are
more oppressive to their provinces than despotic
governments. Or, in other words, that the <i>subjects</i>
of free<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> states are worse slaves than the
subjects of states not free. This is one of the
observations which Mr. <span class="smcap">Hume</span> represents as an
universal axiom in politicks<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.—“Though,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_39" id="Page_2_39">[39]</a></span>
says he, free governments have been commonly
the most happy for those who partake of their
freedom, yet are they the most oppressive and
ruinous to their provinces; and this observation
may be fixed as an universal axiom in politics.
What cruel tyrants were the Romans over the
world during the time of their commonwealth?—After
the dissolution of the commonwealth
the Roman yoke became easier upon the provinces,
as <i>Tacitus</i> informs us; and it may be
observed, that many of the worst Emperors
(<i>Domitian</i>, for instance) were very careful to
prevent all oppression of the provinces.—The
oppression and tyranny of the <i>Carthaginians</i>
over their subject states in <i>Africa</i> went so far,
as we learn from <i>Polybius</i> (Lib. i. cap. 72.)
that not content with exacting the <i>half</i> of all
the produce of the ground, which of itself was a
very high rent, they also loaded them with many
other taxes.—If we pass from antient to modern
times we shall always find the observation to
hold. The provinces of absolute monarchies
are always better treated than those of free
states.”</p>

<p>Thirdly, Among the worst sorts of governments
I reckon all governments by a corrupt representation.—There
is no instance in which
the trite observation is more true than in this,
“that the best things when corrupted become the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_40" id="Page_2_40">[40]</a></span>
worst.” A corrupt representation is so far from
being any <i>defence</i> against oppression, that it is a
<i>support</i> to it. Long established customs, in this
case, afford no security, because, under the sanction
of such a representation, they may be easily
undermined or counteracted; nor is there any injury
to a people which, with the help of such an
instrument, may not be committed with safety.
It is not, however, every degree of corruption,
that will destroy the use of a representation, and
turn it into an evil so dreadful. In order to this,
corruption must pass a certain limit. But <i>every
degree</i> of it <i>tends</i> to this, saps the foundation of
Liberty, and poisons the fountain of Legislation.
And when it gets to its last stage, and has proceeded
its utmost length: When, in particular,
the means by which candidates get themselves
chosen are such as admit the <i>worst</i>, but exclude
the <i>best</i> men; a House of Representatives becomes
little better than a sink into which is collected all
that is most worthless and vile in a kingdom.—There
cannot be a greater calamity than such a
government.—It is impossible there should be
a condition more wretched than that of a nation,
once free, so degenerated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_41" id="Page_2_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_PART_I_CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">It is time to dismiss this subject. But I cannot
take a final leave of it, (and probably of all
subjects of this kind) without adding the following
reflections on our own state in this kingdom.</p>

<p class="tb">It is well known, that <span class="smcap">Montesquieu</span> has paid
the highest compliment to this country, by describing
its constitution of government, in giving an account
of a perfect government; and by drawing the
character of its inhabitants, in giving an account of
the manners and characters of a free people.—“All
(he says) having, in free states, a share in
government, and the laws not being made for
some more than others, they consider themselves
as <i>monarchs</i>, and are more properly <i>confederates
than fellow-subjects</i>.—No one citizen being
subject to another, each sets a greater value on
his Liberty than on the glory of any of his fellow-citizens.—Being
independent, they are
proud; for the pride of kings is founded on
their independence.—They are in a constant
ferment, and believe themselves in danger,
even in those moments when they are most
safe.—They reason; but it is indifferent whether
they reason well or ill. It is sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_42" id="Page_2_42">[42]</a></span>
that they <i>do</i> reason. Hence springs that Liberty
which is their security.—This state,
however, will lose its Liberty. It will perish,
when the <i>Legislative</i> power shall become more
corrupt than the <i>executive</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Such is the account which this great writer
gave, many years ago, of the <i>British</i> constitution
and people. We may learn from it, that we have
nothing to fear from that disposition to examine
every public measure, to censure ministers of state,
and to be restless and clamorous, which has hitherto
characterized us.—On the contrary;
we shall have every thing to fear, when this
disposition is lost. As soon as a people grow
secure, and cease to be quick in taking alarms,
they are undone. A free constitution of government
cannot be preserved without an earnest
and unremitting jealousy. <span class="smcap">Our</span> Constitution,
in particular, is so excellent, that it is the properest
object of such a jealousy. For my own
part, I admire so much the general frame and
principles of it, that I could be almost satisfied
with that representation of the kingdom, which
forms the most important part of it, had I no
other objection to this representation than its <i>inadequateness</i>.
Did it consist of a body of men, fairly
elected for a short term, by a number of independent
persons, of all orders in every part of the kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_43" id="Page_2_43">[43]</a></span>
equal to the number of the present voters;
and were it, after being elected, under no undue
influence; it would be a security of such importance,
that I should be less disposed to complain
of the injustice done, by its inadequateness, to the
greatest part of the kingdom by depriving them
of one their natural and unalienable rights. To
such a body of representatives we might commit,
with confidence, the guardianship of our rights,
knowing, that having one interest with the rest
of the state, they could not violate them; or
that if they ever did, a little time would bring
the power of gaining redress without tumult or
violence.—Happy the people so blessed.—If
wise, they will endeavour, by every possible
method, to preserve the purity of their representation;
and, should it have degenerated, they will
lose no time in effecting a reformation of it.—But
if, unhappily, infection should have pervaded
the whole mass of the state, and there should be
no room to hope for any reformation, it will be
still some consolation to reflect, that slavery, in all
its rigour, will not immediately follow. Between
the time in which the securities of Liberty are
undermined, and its final subversion, there is commonly
a flattering interval during which the <i>enjoyment</i>
of Liberty may be continued, in consequence
of fundamental laws and rooted habits
which cannot be at once exterminated. And this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_44" id="Page_2_44">[44]</a></span>
interval is longer or shorter, according as the
progress of corruption is more or less rapid; and
men in power more or less attentive to improve
favourable opportunities.—The government
of this country, in particular, is so well balanced,
and the institutions of our common law are so
admirable, and have taken such deep root, that
we can bear much decay before our liberties fall.—Fall,
however, they must, if our public affairs
do not soon take a new turn. That very
evil, which, according to the great writer I have
quoted, is to produce our ruin, we see working
every where and increasing every day.—The
following facts, among many others, shew too
plainly whither we are tending and how far we
are advanced.</p>

<p>First. It seems to me, that a general indifference
is gaining ground fast among us.—This is the
necessary effect of increasing luxury and dissipation;
but there is another cause of it, which I think
of with particular regret.—In consequence of having
been often duped by false patriots; and found,
that the leaders of opposition, when they get into
places, forget all their former declarations; the
nation has been led to a conviction, that all patriotism
is imposture, and all opposition to the
measures of government nothing but a struggle for
power and its emoluments. The honest and independent
part of the nation entertain at present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_45" id="Page_2_45">[45]</a></span>
most of this conviction; and, therefore, having
few public men to whom they can look with
confidence, they give up all zeal, and sink into
inactivity and despondence.</p>

<p>Secondly. At the Revolution, the House of
Commons acquired its just weight in the constitution;
and, for some years afterwards, it was often
giving much trouble to men in power. Of late,
it is well known, that means have been tryed and
a system adopted for quieting it.—I will not say
with what success—But I must say, that the
men whose policy this has been, have struck at
the very <i>heart</i> of public liberty, and are the worst
traitors this kingdom ever saw.—“If ever,
(says Judge <i>Blackstone</i>) it should happen, that
the independency of any one of the three
branches of our legislature should be lost; or
that it should become subservient to the views
of either of the other two, there would soon be
an end of our constitution. The legislature
would be changed from that which was originally
set up by the general consent and fundamental
act of the society; and such a change,
however effected, is according to Mr. <i>Locke</i>
(who perhaps carries his theory too far) at
once an entire dissolution of the bands of
government, and the people are thereby
reduced to a state of anarchy, with liberty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_46" id="Page_2_46">[46]</a></span>
to constitute to themselves a new legislative
power.”<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Thirdly. Soon after the <span class="smcap">Revolution</span>, bills for
triennial parliaments passed both Houses, in opposition
to the court<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. At the <span class="smcap">Accession</span>, septennial
parliaments were established. Since this last
period, many attempts have been made, by the
friends of the constitution, to restore triennial parliaments;
and, formerly, it was not without difficulty
that the ministry were able to defeat these
attempts. The division in the House of Commons
in 1735, on a bill for this purpose, was 247 to
184.—I need not say, that <i>now</i> all such attempts
drop of themselves. So much are the sentiments
of our representatives changed in this instance, that
the motion for such a bill, annually made by a
worthy member of the House of Commons, can
scarcely produce a serious debate, or gain the least
attention.—For several years, at the beginning
of the last reign, the <span class="smcap">House of Commons</span> constantly
passed <i>pension</i> and <i>place</i> bills, which were as constantly
rejected by the <span class="smcap">House of Lords</span>. At present,
no one is so romantic as ever to think of introducing
any such bills into the House of Commons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_47" id="Page_2_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Fourthly. Standing armies have in all ages
been destructive to the Liberties of the states into
which they have been admitted.—<span class="smcap">Montesquieu</span><a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
observes, that the preservation of Liberty in
<span class="smcap">England</span> requires, that it should have no land
forces.—Dr. <span class="smcap">Ferguson</span> calls the establishment
of standing armies “A <span class="smcap">fatal Refinement</span> in
the present state of civil government.”<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>—Mr.
<i>Hume</i> pronounces “our standing army a
mortal distemper in the British constitution, of
which it must <i>inevitably</i> perish.”<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>—Formerly,
the nation was apprehensive of this danger; and
the <i>standing army</i> was a constant subject of warm
debate in both Houses of Parliament. The principal
reason then assigned for continuing it was,
the security of the House of <span class="smcap">Hanover</span> against
the friends of the <i>Pretender</i>. This is a reason
which now exists no more; the House of <i>Hanover</i>
being so well established as not to want any such
security.—The standing army also is now more
numerous and formidable than ever; and yet all
opposition to it is lost, and it is become in a manner
a part of the constitution.</p>

<p>Fifthly. For many years after the accession the
national debt was thought an evil so alarming,
that the reduction of it was recommended every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_48" id="Page_2_48">[48]</a></span>
year from the throne to the attention of Parliament
as an object of the last importance. The
<span class="smcap">Fund</span> appropriated to this purpose was called the
<span class="smcapuc">ONLY HOPE</span> of the kingdom; and when the practice
of alienating it begun, it was reckoned a
kind of sacrilege, and zealously opposed in the
House of <i>Commons</i>, and protested against in the
House of <i>Lords</i>. But now, though the debt is
almost <i>tripled</i>, we sit under it with perfect indifference;
and the sacred fund, which repeated laws
had ordered to be applied <i>to no other purpose</i> than
the redemption of it, is always alienated of course,
and become a constant part of the current supplies,
and much more an encouragement to dissipation
than a preservative from bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Sixthly. Nothing is more the duty of the representatives
of a nation than to keep a strict eye
over the expenditure of the money granted for
public services.—In the reign of King William,
the House of Commons passed almost every year
bills for appointing commissioners for taking,
stating and examining the public accounts; and,
particularly, the army and navy debts and contracts.
In the reign of Queen Ann such bills
became less frequent. But since the accession,
only two motions have been made for such bills;
one in 1715, and the other in 1741; and both
were rejected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_49" id="Page_2_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Seventhly. I hope I may add, that there was a
time when the kingdom could not have been brought
to acquiesce in what was done in the case of the
<i>Middlesex</i> election. This is a precedent which, by
giving the House of Commons the power of excluding
its members at discretion, and of introducing
others in their room on a minority of
votes, has a tendency to make it a self-created
House, and to destroy entirely the right of
representation: And a few more such precedents
would completely overthrow the constitution.</p>

<p>Lastly. I cannot help mentioning here the
addition which has been lately made to the power
of the Crown, by throwing into its hands the <i>East-India
Company</i>. Nothing more unfavourable to
the security of public Liberty has been done since
the <span class="smcap">Revolution</span>: And should our statesmen,
thus strengthened by the patronage of the <span class="smcap">East</span>,
be farther strengthened by the conquest and patronage
of the <span class="smcap">West</span>, they will indeed have no
small reason for triumph; and there will be little
left to protect us against the encroachments and
usurpations of power. <span class="smcap">Rome</span> sunk into slavery,
in consequence of enlarging its territories, and
becoming the center of the wealth of conquered
provinces, and the seat of universal empire. It
seems the appointment of Providence, that free
states, when, not contented with <i>self</i>-government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_50" id="Page_2_50">[50]</a></span>
and prompted by the love of domination, they make
themselves masters of other states, shall lose Liberty
at the same time that they take it away; and, by
subduing, be themselves subdued. Distant and dependent
provinces can be governed only by a military
force. And a military force which governs
abroad, will soon govern at home. The <i>Romans</i>
were so sensible of this, that they made it treason
for any of their generals to march their armies
over the <i>Rubicon</i> into <i>Italy</i>. <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>, therefore,
when he came to this river, hesitated; but he
passed it, and enslaved his country.</p>

<p>“Among the circumstances (says Dr. <span class="smcap">Ferguson</span>)
which in the event of national prosperity
and in the result of commercial arts, lead to
the establishment of despotism, there is none
perhaps that arrives at this termination with so
sure an aim as the perpetual enlargement of territory.
In every state the freedom of its members
depends on the balance and adjustment of
its interior parts; and the existence of any such
freedom among mankind depends on the balance
of nations. In the progress of conquest
those who are subdued are said to have lost their
liberties. But, from the history of mankind,
to conquer or to be conquered has appeared in
effect the same.”<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_51" id="Page_2_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Many more facts of this kind might easily be
enumerated; but these are sufficient.—They
shew, with sad evidence, how fast we have, for
some time, been advancing towards the greatest
of all public calamities.</p>

<p>We may, also, infer from the preceding observations,
that there is only one way in which our
deliverance is possible; and that is, by <span class="smcap">Restoring
our grand national Security</span>. This is
the object which our great men in opposition
ought to hold forth to the kingdom, and to
bind themselves by some decisive tests to do all
they can to obtain. That patriotism must be
spurious which does not carry its views principally
to this. Without it, nothing is of great
importance to the kingdom; and even an accommodation
with <i>America</i> would only preserve
a limb, and save from present danger, while a
gangrene was left to consume the vitals.</p>

<p>But, probably, we are gone too far; and corruption
has struck its roots too deep to leave us
much room for hope.—Mr. <span class="smcap">Hume</span> has observed,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
that as the affairs of this country are
not likely to take a turn favourable to the establishment
of a perfect plan of Liberty, “an absolute
monarchy is the easiest death, the true
<span class="smcap">Euthanasia</span> of the British constitution.”—If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_52" id="Page_2_52">[52]</a></span>
this observation is just, our constitution (should
no great calamity intervene) is likely, in some
future period, to receive a very quiet dissolution.—At
present, however, it must be acknowledged,
that we enjoy a degree of Liberty, civil and
religious, which has seldom been paralleled among
mankind. We ought to rejoice in this happiness;
and to be graceful to that benevolent disposer of
all events who blesses us with it. But, at the
same time, our hearts must bleed when we reflect,
that, the supports of it having given way, it is
little more than a <i>sufferance</i> which we owe to
the temper of the times; the lenity of our governors;
and some awe, in which the friends
of despotism are still held, by the voice and spirit
of the uncorrupted part of the kingdom.—May
these causes, if no better securities can be hoped
for, long delay our fate.</p>

<p class="tb">It must not be forgotten, that all I have now
said is meant on the supposition, that our affairs
will proceed smoothly till, by a common and natural
progress, we have gone the round of other
nations once free, and are brought to their end.—But
it is possible this may not happen.—Our
circumstances are singular; and give us reason
to fear, that we have before us a death which
will not be easy or common.</p>

<span class="smcap">Remarks</span> on some Particulars in a
<span class="smcap">Speech</span> at opening the <span class="smcap">Budget</span> in
<i>April 1776</i>.</span></h2>

<span class="smaller"><i>Supplemental Observations on the Surplus of the
Revenue; the Quantity of Coin in the
Kingdom; and Paper-Credit.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">It is well known, that the great minister who
presides over our finances, took occasion, at
opening the Budget in April last, to enter into a
particular account of the state of the nation. In
this account, he represented us as in a condition the
most sound and happy; our trade and revenue
flourishing; our common people well provided
for; our debts and taxes light; our current
specie sufficiently ample; our paper-circulation
safe; and the <span class="smcap">Bank</span>, in particular, as little less
firm and durable than the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_54" id="Page_2_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>This account, so encouraging and flattering,
was generally understood to be given in designed
opposition to another account very different, which
had been given in the <i>Observations on Civil Liberty</i>.—It
cannot, therefore, I hope, be thought
too presuming in me to offer the following remarks
in my own defence.</p>

<p class="tb">I have grounded my opinion of the hazardous
state of the kingdom, partly on the smallness of
the surplus in the revenue, and the nature and
circumstances of our paper-circulation, compared
with the quantity of <i>specie</i> in the kingdom, and
the weight of our debts and taxes.</p>

<p>The surplus of the revenue I have made out in
two different methods; and by a deduction so
minute, that it is, I think, scarcely possible it
should be materially wrong. One of these methods
brings it out 338,759<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i><a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>: and the
other, 300,000<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i> supposing the expence
of calling in the gold coin, and the profits of
lotteries excluded; the land-tax at three shillings
in the pound; and the peace establishment the
same that it has been at a medium for eleven years,
from 1764 to 1775.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said in opposition to this,
than a general intimation, that had it not been for
the war with <i>America</i>, the peace-establishment for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_55" id="Page_2_55">[55]</a></span>
the navy would have been reduced, and a sufficient
surplus gained (including lotteries) to enable parliament
to pay off a million every year of the
public debt.</p>

<p class="tb">I am very sensible that reductions of the public
expences and improvements in the revenue are
practicable, which would give such a surplus. But
I am afraid, they will never take place. Nor can
I think it proper, in determining what permanent
surplus we possess, to include those pernicious
profits of lotteries, by which infinitely more is
upon the whole lost than gained; or, to form our
judgment of the expence of <i>future</i> years, by any
other rule than the medium expence of <i>past</i> years.—It
would, however, give little consolation,
were there a certainty that, had peace continued,
a <span class="smcapuc">MILLION</span> annually of the public debt would have
been discharged. This would have made a very
slow progress in discharging our debts. A million
every year discharged in peace, and eight or
ten millions every year added in war, would leave
us under the necessity of breaking at last. But
hitherto we have not proceeded in a course so
favourable. The great person to whom I refer,
must know, that in 1772, he announced in the
<i>House of Commons</i>, his intention to pay off a <i>million
and a half</i> every year, and <span class="smcapuc">SEVENTEEN MILLIONS</span>
in ten years; that yet only 2.800,000<i>l.</i>
was paid off in the three subsequent years; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_56" id="Page_2_56">[56]</a></span>
that, on account of the increase of the <i>navy</i> and
<i>civil-list</i> debts, there has not been in fact the
ability (without the help of lotteries) to pay half
that sum.</p>

<p class="tb">In page 74th of the <i>Observations on Civil Liberty</i>,
I have said, “that it has appeared lately,
that the gold specie of the kingdom, is no
more than about <span class="smcapuc">TWELVE MILLIONS AND A
HALF</span>.”—This assertion has been much controverted;
and it is therefore necessary I should
give a distinct account of the reasons on which it
was grounded.</p>

<p>I had learnt from unquestionable authority,
that the quantity of gold coin brought into the
mint, by the Acts of Parliament and Proclamations
in 1773 and 1774, was about <span class="smcapuc">NINE MILLIONS</span><a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>;
or as much as, when recoined, amounted nearly
to that sum.—I find also, that it was expected
by the best judges, that the proclamation lately
issued would bring in about <i>three</i> millions. These
two sums make up <i>twelve</i> millions; and they include
the gold coin of <i>Ireland</i>. Let this be estimated
at a<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> million; and the whole gold coin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_57" id="Page_2_57">[57]</a></span>
of <i>Britain</i>, to be brought in by all the calls, will
be <span class="smcapuc">ELEVEN</span> millions; and none will remain, except
that part which was deficient less than a grain
in a guinea, and remained in the kingdom, at the
time the coin Act took effect in June 1773. We
are here left entirely to conjecture. But it should
be remembered, that for many years before 1773,
the heavy coin was catched up as soon as issued,
and either clipped, or melted down and exported;
and that from hence arose such a scarcity of
heavy coin, that, in some counties, heavy guineas
might be disposed of at a premium.—In such
circumstances, an allowance of about a million
and a half, for the coin deficient less than a grain
in a guinea before the coin Act in 1773, seems to
be sufficient; and therefore, it might, I think,
with reason be said, that it appeared that the gold
coin of the kingdom was about <span class="smcapuc">TWELVE MILLIONS
AND A HALF</span>.</p>

<p class="tb">But there is another reason, by which I have
been convinced, that this is a moderate estimate.</p>

<p>The quantity of gold coin, deficient between
three and six grains in a guinea, was 4.800,000<i>l.</i>
and this, when recoined, made 4.600,000<i>l.</i>—The
coin deficient less than three grains could
not have been so much, for the following reasons.
First, new coin being rougher, wears faster than
old coin; and therefore, does not remain so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_58" id="Page_2_58">[58]</a></span>
in any given degree of deficiency.—Secondly, coin,
deficient less than three grains, is subject to several
peculiar causes of diminution and destruction.—Clipping
and sweating remove part of it to greater
degrees of deficiency; and part is destroyed by
being melted down and exported; whereas,
lighter coin is diminished only by being worn<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_59" id="Page_2_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>These reasons seem to prove, that if the gold
coin, deficient in June 1773 less than three grains,
is estimated at <i>five millions</i>, (that is, at a little
more than the coin deficient between three and
six grains) it will be rated rather too high; and
the conclusion will be, that the whole of our gold
coin (exclusive of the <i>Irish</i>) might possibly be <i>less</i>,
but could not have been <i>much more</i>, than the sum
at which I have reckoned it.</p>

<p class="tb">Such have been the facts and arguments by
which my judgment has been determined in this
instance.—But it must not be overlooked, that
it helps only to ascertain the quantity of <i>circulating</i>
specie in the kingdom, as distinguished from that
which is <i>hoarded</i>. When the <i>Observations on Civil
Liberty</i> were published, I did not apprehend, that
this part of the coin could be considerable enough
to deserve regard. But the contrary has lately
appeared. The Proclamation issued last summer,
and which it was expected would bring in about
three millions, has, I am informed, brought in about
<i>six millions and a half</i>. This exceeds the sum at
which I have been led to state the <i>whole</i> gold coin
deficient less than three grains; and proves, that
several millions must have been hoarded<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>. Nor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_60" id="Page_2_60">[60]</a></span>
I think, will this appear incredible, when it is recollected,
that only gold coin under three grains
of deficiency is likely to be hoarded; and also,
that distrust of the <i>Funds</i> and of Paper-money has
a particular tendency to increase the practice of
hoarding.</p>

<p>Assisted, therefore, by this new light, I would
now state the <i>circulating</i> gold coin of the kingdom
before 1773, nearly as I did before; and call it
<span class="smcapuc">TWELVE</span> or <span class="smcapuc">THIRTEEN MILLIONS</span>. But the whole
gold coin (including the hoarded part) I would
reckon at <span class="smcapuc">SIXTEEN</span> or <span class="smcapuc">SEVENTEEN MILLIONS</span><a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.</p>

<p class="tb">An account very different from this was given
at opening the Budget; the substance of which
I will state as faithfully as my memory will
enable me; and just as I understood it.</p>

<p>“From the beginning of the year 1772, to
the 23d of April last, 13.200,000<i>l</i>. had been
coined at the Tower; and on that day there
was 600,000<i>l</i>. more ready to be coined.—All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_61" id="Page_2_61">[61]</a></span>
this, (it was intimated) is now left in the
kingdom. The last Proclamation, it was expected,
would bring in three millions more;
which, added to the coin deficient less than a
grain resting in the kingdom at the time of the
Coin Act in 1773, and issued before 1772,
will make the whole, <span class="smcap">Eighteen or Nineteen
Millions</span><a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.”</p>

<p class="tb">On this account I would observe,</p>

<p>First. That if just, it proves that, in 1773, a
<i>third</i> at least of the <i>circulating</i> coin was in the best
state possible. For the late calls having shewn,
that there was then, in <i>Britain</i> and <i>Ireland</i>, no
more than about twelve <i>millions</i> deficient <i>more</i>
than a grain; six millions (that is, a third of
eighteen millions) or seven millions (that is, more
than a third of nineteen millions) must have been
deficient <i>less</i> than a grain.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>—It will also follow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_62" id="Page_2_62">[62]</a></span>
(since the quantity brought in by the first call is
known to have been 4.900,000l.) that but little
more than a <i>fourth</i> could have been deficient so
much as six grains, or a shilling in a guinea.—No
person can think this credible who recollects
the distress of traffic, and the complaints of the
kingdom before 1773.</p>

<p>Secondly. The truth of the account I have
stated depends, in a great measure, on the supposition,
that all the gold coined since the beginning
of 1772 is now in the kingdom. I cannot conceive
on what grounds this was taken for granted.—From
the beginning of 1772 to June 1773,
the practice of clipping was more prevalent
than it had ever been. During the greatest part
of 1772, the price of gold was so much above
mint price, that a profit, from 2 to 4 <i>per cent</i>.
might be got by melting heavy guineas<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. And,
in February in that year, the price of gold was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_63" id="Page_2_63">[63]</a></span>
4l. 1s. 6d. per ounce; and 4½ <i>per cent.</i> might
be got by melting heavy guineas. Instead, therefore,
of believing, that all the gold coined since
the beginning of 1772 remains with us; I think
it almost certain, that the greatest part of all
coined during the first year and a half of this period,
has been either clipped or melted into bullion.
That part which was clipped has been recoined;
and that part which was melted has been
either recoined or exported; and, therefore, neither
has made any addition to the coin of the
kingdom.</p>

<p>These observations demonstrate, that the
amount of the gold coin at the time of the Coin
Act in 1773, must have been near the sum at
which I have reckoned it. There may, for ought
I know, have been an increase since; but I shall
not believe there has, till I know, whether the coin
brought in by the last proclamation has been all
recoined and issued. But this cannot be expected;
for should it be done, <span class="smcap">Four Millions</span><a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> more
will have been coined and issued, than has been
brought in.—The truth, therefore, may be,
that the coinage, since June 1773, has been carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_64" id="Page_2_64">[64]</a></span>
on only to provide a supply of new coin to
be exchanged for old; in which case, the
quantity of coin in the kingdom, even according
to this method of computing it, will come out
nearly the same with that which I have given.</p>

<p class="tb">After all, let the <i>specie</i> of the kingdom, including
the silver, be allowed to be as considerable as
some have asserted; or about four millions more
than I have reckoned it; the difference arising
from hence will not be of particular consequence;
and it will be still true, that notwithstanding all
our increase of trade and apparent opulence, the
<i>specie</i> of the kingdom<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> is not much more than
it was at the <i>Revolution</i>.—What then is all the
rest of our circulating cash? What is it keeps
up rents; feeds our luxury; pays our taxes;
supplies the revenue, and supports government?—Paper,
chiefly, emitted, not only at the Bank,
but by tradesmen, merchants, and bankers in every
corner of the kingdom.—And is this a solid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_65" id="Page_2_65">[65]</a></span>
and permanent support?<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Is there, in the annals
of the world, another instance of a great
kingdom so supported?—The causes are numberless
which may suddenly destroy it; and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_66" id="Page_2_66">[66]</a></span>
this to happen, we should fall at once, with a
debt of 140 millions upon us, to the state we were
in before the <span class="smcap">Revolution</span>.—Imagination cannot
paint to itself the shock this would give.—I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_67" id="Page_2_67">[67]</a></span>
must repeat here what I have said in the <i>Observations
on Civil Liberty</i>, page 73, &amp;c. that we
should think of nothing but guarding ourselves
against the danger of such a situation, by restricting
our paper currency, and gradually discharging
our public debts.—In giving this admonition, I
look upon myself as doing my country one of
the best offices in my power; and acting in the
character of one who calls to another to awake
who is sleeping over a precipice.—But I know
I call in vain.—The great minister who directs
our finances has assured us all is well; and,
under this persuasion, we are advancing, with
unsuspicious and careless speed, to the catastrophe
I have pointed out; and pursuing measures which
must increase the difficulty of avoiding it, and
the distress attending it.</p>

<p>Among these measures I have mentioned the
present new coinage.—Before this coinage, I
have observed, the light money always remained,
because nothing could be got by melting and exporting
it. But now, as soon as gold rises to the
price it bore for many years before 1773, the
melters and exporters of coin will be saved the
trouble of selection; and every piece on which
they can lay their hands will be proper for their
purpose.—It seems, therefore, obvious, that, in
consequence of this measure, all our coin may be
carried away, and the whole superstructure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_68" id="Page_2_68">[68]</a></span>
paper supported by it, break down, before we
are aware of any danger.</p>

<p>I will take this opportunity to add, that this
measure will at the same time increase our paper.
This has been the consequence of the two former
calls; but it will probably be more the consequence
of the last call. For, as no coin is now
to be current which is more than a grain deficient;
and as also a great deal of it is already at
or near that limit; the vexation attending it will
be so intolerable, that it will be generally cried
down, and paper substituted in its room.—Certain
it is, that nothing can prevent this evil,
but another evil; I mean, the deficient coin
forcing itself again into circulation, and furnishing
clippers with more employment than ever; and,
consequently, a return, with increased violence, of
the confusion and distress which took place before
the Coin Act in 1773.—This, indeed, will be
much the least of the two evils; nor, in my opinion,
are there any methods of preventing the diminution
of the coin, which will not produce greater
evils, except such alterations in its form<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> as
shall render clipping less practicable, joined to the
execution of severe laws against clippers, and a
strict vigilance in detecting them.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, it seems to me, that enough
had been done by the first coin act to restore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_69" id="Page_2_69">[69]</a></span>
gold coin; and that all which has been done since, at
the expence of about 650,000l. has been nothing
but a preparation of the coin for melters and
exporters, to the dreadful hazard of the kingdom.—These
are my present views of this
subject. But I must say, that I suspect my own
judgment in this instance. The noble Lord,
who is furnished with infinitely more of the means
of information than I am, intimated, if I remember
rightly, that there is no such danger: And
though I did not understand the reason he assigned
for this assertion, I must believe, that, in a matter
so particularly interesting to the kingdom, he
has gone upon the best evidence.</p>

<h3 id="II_PART_II_SECT_II">SECT. II.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the State of the Nation; and the War
with America.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">At the beginning of the preceding section,
I have taken notice of the flattering account
which was given, at opening the Budget in
April last, of the state of the kingdom with respect
to its commerce, revenue, and opulence.
On that account I shall beg leave to offer the
following reflections.</p>

<p class="tb">First. The observations in the last section prove,
I think, that it is not so well supported by facts, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_70" id="Page_2_70">[70]</a></span>
there is reason to wish. I am sensible, indeed,
that we never made a more gay and splendid appearance.
But no considerate person will draw
much encouragement from hence. That pride
and security; that luxury, venality and dissipation
which give us this appearance, are melancholy
symptoms; and have hitherto been the forerunners
of distress and calamity.</p>

<p>Secondly. When this account was given there
was a particular end to be answered by it. Additional
taxes were to be imposed; and it was necessary
to reconcile the public to the prospect of a great
increase of its burthens, in order to carry on the
war with <i>America</i>.—On other occasions, different
accounts had been given. In order to
prove the justice of taxing the <i>Americans</i>, the
weight of our own taxes had been often insisted
upon; and the difficulty of raising a sufficient
force among ourselves to reduce them, had been
urged as a reason for seeking and employing, at
a great expence, the assistance of foreign powers.
On such occasions, I have heard our unhappy and
embarrassed situation mentioned; and, at the end
of the last session of Parliament, one of our
greatest men, whose opinion in favour of coercion,
had contributed to bring us into our
present situation, acknowledged the distress attending
it, and represented the vessel of the state
as having never before rode in so dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_71" id="Page_2_71">[71]</a></span>
a storm.—This is, without doubt, the truth.
But, if the account on which I am remarking
was just, we were then safe and happy; nor was
the vessel of the state ever wafted by more gentle
and prosperous gales.</p>

<p>But the reflection which, on this occasion, has
given me most pain is the following.</p>

<p>If, without <i>America</i>, we can be in a state so
flourishing, a war to reduce <i>America</i> must be
totally inexcuseable. I wish I could engage
attention to this. War is a dreadful evil; and
those who involve a people in it <i>needlessly</i>, will
find they have much to answer for. Nothing
can ever justify it, but the necessity of it to
secure some <i>essential</i> interest against unjust attacks.
But, it seems, there is no interest to be
secured by the present war. The revenue has
never flourished so much, as since <i>America</i> has been
rendered hostile to us; and it is now reckoned
by many a decided point, that little depends on
the <i>American</i> trade. It follows then, that if
the end of the present war is to “obtain a revenue,”
it is a revenue we do not want; if “to
maintain authority,” it is an authority of no
use to us.—Must not humanity shudder at such
a war?—Why not let <i>America</i> alone, if we
can subsist without it?—Why carry fire and
sword into a happy country to do ourselves no
good?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_72" id="Page_2_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the very persons who depreciate the
value of the colonies, as a support to our revenue
and finances, yet say, that we are now under a
necessity of reducing them, or perishing. I wish
such persons would give an account of the causes
which, according to their ideas, create this dreadful
necessity. Is it the same that led <i>Haman</i> of old
to reckon all his honours and treasures nothing to
him, while <i>Mordecai</i> the Jew would not bow to
him?—Or, are we become so luxurious, that
luxury even in the revenue is become necessary to
us; and so depraved, that, like many individuals in
private life, having lost <i>self</i>-dominion, we cannot
subsist without dominion over <i>others</i>?</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten, that I speak here on
the supposition, that it is possible for this country
to be as safe and prosperous without <i>America</i> as
some have asserted, and as was implied in what
was said at opening the last Budget.—This is
far from being my own opinion.—Some time or
other we shall, in all probability, feel severely, in
our commerce and finances, the loss of the colonies.
As a source of revenue they are, I think,
of great importance to us; but they are still more
important as supports to our navy, and an aid to
us in our wars. It appears now, that there is
a force among them so formidable and so growing,
that, with its assistance, any of the great <i>European</i>
powers may soon make themselves masters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_73" id="Page_2_73">[73]</a></span>
of all the <i>West-Indies</i> and <i>North-America</i>; and nothing
ought to be more alarming to us than that
our natural enemies see this, and are influenced
by it.—With the colonies united to us, we
might be the greatest and happiest nation that
ever existed. But with the colonies separated
from us, and in alliance with <i>France</i> and <i>Spain</i>,
we are no more a people.—They appear, therefore,
to be indeed worth any price.—Our existence
depends on keeping them.—But <span class="smcapuc">HOW</span>
are they to be kept?—Most certainly, not by
forcing them to unconditional submission at the
expence of many millions of money and rivers of
blood. The resolution to attempt this, is a
melancholy instance of that infatuation, which
sometimes influences the councils of kingdoms.
It is attempting to keep them by a method, which,
if it succeeds, will destroy their use, and make
them not worth the having; and which, if it does
<i>not</i> succeed, will throw them into the scale of
rival powers, kindle a general war, and undo the
empire.</p>

<p>The extension of our territories in <i>America</i>, during
the last war, increased the expence of our
<i>peace</i>-establishment, from 2.400,000l. <i>per ann.</i> to
four millions <i>per ann.</i>—Almost all the provinces
in <i>America</i>, which used to be ours, are now to be
conquered. Let the expence of this be stated at
25 or 30 millions; or, at a capital bearing a million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_74" id="Page_2_74">[74]</a></span>
<i>per annum</i> interest.—<i>America</i> recovered by
the sword must be kept by the sword, and forts
and garrisons must be maintained in every province
to awe the wretched inhabitants, and to
hold them in subjection. This will create another
addition of expence; and both together cannot,
I suppose, be stated at less than two millions
<i>per annum</i>.—But how is such an increase of revenue
to be procured?—The colonies, desolated
and impoverished, will yield no revenue.—The
surplusses of the sinking fund have, for many
years, formed a necessary part of the current and
ordinary supplies.—It must, therefore, be drawn
from <i>new</i> taxes.—But can the kingdom bear
such an increase of taxes? Or, if it can, where
shall we find a surplus for discharging an enormous
debt of above 160 millions? And what
will be our condition, when the next foreign war
shall add two millions <i>per annum</i> more to our expences?—Indeed
this is a frightful prospect. But
it will be rendered infinitely more frightful
by carrying our views to that increase of the
power of the Crown which will arise from the
increase of the army, from the disposal of new
places without number, and the patronage of the
whole continent of <i>North-America</i>.</p>

<p>These consequences have been stated moderately
on the supposition, that we shall succeed in subduing
<i>America</i>; and that, while we are doing it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_75" id="Page_2_75">[75]</a></span>
our natural enemies will neglect the opportunity
offered them, and continue to satisfy themselves
with assisting <i>America indirectly</i>.—But should
the contrary happen.—I need not say what will
follow.</p>

<p>Some time ago this horrid danger might have
been avoided, and the colonies kept by the
easiest means.—By a prudent lenity and moderation.—By
receiving their petitions.—By
giving up the right we claim to dispose of their
property, and to alter their governments.—By
guarantying to them, in these respects, a legislative
independence;<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and establishing them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_76" id="Page_2_76">[76]</a></span>
the possession of equal liberty with ourselves.—This
a great and magnanimous nation should
have done. This, since the commencement
of hostilities, would have brought them back
to their former habits of respect and subordination;
and might have bound them to us for
ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montesquieu</span> has observed, that <span class="smcap">England</span>, in
planting colonies, should have <i>commerce</i>, not <i>dominion</i>,
in view; the increase of dominion being incompatible
with the security of public liberty.—Every
advantage that could arise from commerce
they have offered us without reserve; and their
language to us has been—“Restrict us, as much
as you please, in <i>acquiring</i> property by regulating
our trade for your advantage; but claim
not the disposal of that property after it has
been acquired.—Be satisfied with the authority
you exercised over us before the present reign.—<span class="smcap">Place
us where we were in</span> 1763.”—On
these terms they have repeatedly sued for a reconciliation.
In return, we have denounced
them <i>Rebels</i>; and with our fleets in their ports,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_77" id="Page_2_77">[77]</a></span>
and our bayonets at their breasts, have left
them no other alternative than to acknowledge
our supremacy, and give up rights they think
most sacred; or stand on the defensive, and appeal
to heaven.—They have chosen the latter.</p>

<p>In this situation, if our feelings for <i>others</i> do not
make us tremble, our feelings for <i>ourselves</i> soon
may.—Should we suffer the consequences I
have intimated, our pride will be humbled.—We
shall admire the plans of moderation and
equity which, without bloodshed or danger,
would have kept <i>America</i>.—We shall wish for
the happiness of former times; and remember,
with anguish, the measures which many of us
lately offered their lives and fortunes to support.</p>

<p class="tb">I must not conclude these observations, without
taking particular notice of a charge against
the colonies, which has been much insisted on.—“They
have, it is said, always had independency
in view; and it is this, chiefly, that has produced
their present resistance.”—It is scarcely
possible there should be a more unreasonable
charge. Without all doubt, our connexion with
them might have been preserved for ages to
come, (perhaps <i>for ever</i>) by wise and liberal
treatment. Let any one read a pamphlet published
in 1761, by Dr. <i>Franklin</i>, and entitled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_78" id="Page_2_78">[78]</a></span>
<i>The interest of Great Britain with respect to her
Colonies</i>; and let him deny this if he can.—Before
the present quarrel, there prevailed among them
the purest affection for this country, and the
warmest attachment to the House of <span class="smcap">Hanover</span>.
And since the present quarrel begun, and not
longer ago than the beginning of last winter,
independency was generally dreaded among them.
There is the fullest evidence for this; and all
who are best acquainted with <i>America</i>, must know
it to be true. As a specimen of this evidence,
and of the temper of <i>America</i> till the period I
have mentioned, I will just recite the following
facts.</p>

<p>In the resolutions of the <i>Assembly</i>, which met at
<i>Philadelphia</i>, July 15, 1774, after making the
strongest professions of affection to <i>Britain</i>, and
duty to their sovereign, they declare their abhorrence
of every idea of an unconstitutional independence
on the parent state.—An assembly
of delegates from all the towns of the county of
<i>Suffolk</i> (of which <i>Boston</i> is the capital) delivered in
September 1774, to General Gage, a remonstrance
against fortifying <i>Boston-neck</i>. In this remonstrance,
they totally disclaim every wish of independence.—The
same is done in the instructions
given by the several colonies to the first deputies
chosen for a general Congress.—In the petition
of the first Congress to the King, they declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_79" id="Page_2_79">[79]</a></span>
they shall always, carefully and zealously, endeavour
to support and maintain their connexion
with <i>Great Britain</i>. In the memorial of the same
Congress to the people of this country, they
repeat this assurance.—In the order of the
<i>Congress</i>, which met in May 1775, for a general
fast, they call upon all <i>America</i> to unite in beseeching
the Almighty to avert the judgments
with which they were threatened, and <i>to bless their
rightful Sovereign</i>, that so <i>a reconciliation might be
brought about with the parent state</i>.—And in
their declaration setting forth the causes of their
taking arms, they warn us, “that, should they
find it necessary, foreign assistance was undoubtedly
attainable;” but at the same time declare,
“that they did not mean to dissolve the union
which had so long and so happily subsisted
between them and this country; that necessity
had not yet driven them to that desperate
measure, or induced them to excite any other
nation to war against us; and that they had
not raised armies with ambitious designs of
forming independent states, but solely for the
protection of their property against violence,
and the defence of that freedom which was their
birth-right.”—In the instructions, delivered
Nov. 9, 1775, by a committee of the representatives
of the province of <i>Pensylvania</i>, to their
delegates in the third general congress; they enjoin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_80" id="Page_2_80">[80]</a></span>
them, in behalf of the province, “utterly to
reject any propositions, should such be made,
that might lead to a separation from the mother
country.”</p>

<p>What reason can there be for thinking the
colonies not sincere in all these declarations?—In
truth; it was not possible they should be otherwise
than sincere; for so little did they think of
war, at the time when most of these declarations
were made, that they were totally unprepared for
it: And, even when hostilities were begun at
<span class="smcap">Lexington</span> in April 1775, they were so destitute
of every instrument of defence, particularly ammunition,
that <i>half</i> the force which is now invading
them, would have been sufficient to conquer them
at once.</p>

<p>I will beg leave to add on this occasion, the
following extracts from letters, written by some
leading persons at <span class="smcap">New-York</span>, the genuineness
of which may be depended on.</p>

<p><i>New-York, August</i> 3d. 1775.—“I am
sensible of the many artifices and falshoods
which have been used to biass the minds of
your countrymen, who believe evil reports of
us; and, particularly, that we are aiming at
independence.—Of this be assured, that even
<span class="smcap">Hancock</span> and <span class="smcap">Adams</span> are averse to independence.
There was a lye current last week,
that the congress had finally agreed upon independence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_81" id="Page_2_81">[81]</a></span>
to take place the 10th of March
next, should not our grievances be redressed
before that time. I wrote to one of our
delegates, to enquire whether this report
was true. In his answer he declares, upon
his honour, that he believed there was not
one man in the Congress who would dare to
make a motion tending to independence; or,
that if any one did, two could not be found
to support the motion.—None but those
who are on the spot can conceive what a spirit
is gone forth among all ranks and degrees of
men.—We deserve to be free. It is a heavy
sacrifice we are making. Trade is at an end.
We expect our city to be knocked about our
ears. But I declare solemnly, I will submit to
all, and die in a log-house in the wilds of
America, and be free; rather than flourish in
servitude.”—In a subsequent letter, dated
<span class="smcap">New-York</span>, Jan. 3d. 1776, the same person writes
as follows:—“It is in the power of the
ministry to annihilate all our disputes, by restoring
us to the situation we were in at the
conclusion of the last war. If this is done, we
shall immediately return to our allegiance.
But if not, be assured, that an awful scene will
be opened in the spring. Let me repeat a
caution to you; believe not the insinuations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_82" id="Page_2_82">[82]</a></span>
of our enemies, who would make you all believe
that <i>independence</i> is what <i>America</i> aims at. It
is an insidious falshood. Madmen will be
found in all large societies. It would be
singular, were there none such to be found
in a body of three millions of people and
upwards. But they are like a grain of sand on
the sea shore.”</p>

<p>Another person writes thus.—<span class="smcap">New-York</span>,
Nov. 2d. 1775. “We love and honour our
King. He has no subjects in all his dominions
more attached to his person, family and government,
notwithstanding the epithet of rebels bestowed
upon us. No charge is more unjust
than the charge that we desire an independence
on <i>Great Britain</i>. Ninety-nine in a hundred
of the inhabitants of this country deprecate
this as the heaviest of evils. But if administration
will persist in their present measures, this
will and must inevitably be the event; for
submit to the present claims of the British parliament,
while unrepresented in it, you may be
assured they never will. And what deserves
notice is, that all the violence of <i>Britain</i> only
unites the <i>Americans</i> still more firmly together,
and renders them more determined to be free
or die. This spirit is unconquerable by violence;
but they may be easily won by kindness.—Serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_83" id="Page_2_83">[83]</a></span>
people of all denominations among
us, episcopal and non-episcopal, are much employed
in prayer to God for the success of the
present struggles of <i>America</i>. They consider
their cause as the cause of God; and as such,
they humbly commit it to him, confident of
success in the end, whatever blood or treasure
it may cost them.”</p>

<p>Since these letters were written, the sentiments
of <i>America</i>, with respect to <i>independence</i>, have been
much altered. But it should be remembered,
that this alteration has been owing entirely to <span class="smcapuc">OURSELVES</span>;
I mean, to the measures of the last winter
and summer, and particularly the following.</p>

<p>First. The rejection of the petition from the
Congress brought over by Governor <span class="smcap">Penn</span>. In
this petition they professed, in strong language,
that they still retained their loyalty to the King
and attachment to this country; and only prayed,
“that they might be directed to some mode by
which the united applications of the Colonies
might be improved into a happy reconciliation;
and that, in the mean time, some measures
might be taken for preventing their farther destruction,
and for repealing such statutes as
more immediately distressed them.”—The
Colonies had often petitioned before without
being heard. They had, therefore, little hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_84" id="Page_2_84">[84]</a></span>
from this application; and meant that, if rejected,
it should be their last.</p>

<p>Secondly. The last prohibitory bill, by which
our protection of them was withdrawn; their
ships and effects confiscated; and open war declared
against them.</p>

<p>Thirdly. Employing <i>foreign</i> troops to subdue
them. This produced a greater effect in <i>America</i>
than is commonly imagined. And it is remarkable,
that even the writers in <i>America</i> who answered
the pamphlet entitled <span class="smcap">Common Sense</span>, acknowledge,
that should the <i>British</i> ministry have
recourse to foreign aid, it might become<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> proper
to follow their example, and to embrace the
necessity of resolving upon <i>independence</i>.</p>

<p>I have, further, reason to believe, that the
answer to the last petition of the City of London,
presented in March 1776,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> had no small share
in producing the same effect.</p>

<p>By these measures, and others of the same
kind, those Colonists who had all along most
dreaded and abhorred independence, were at last
reconciled to it.—I can, however, say from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_85" id="Page_2_85">[85]</a></span>
particular information, that even so lately as the
month of June last, an accommodation might
have been obtained with the Colonies, on a reasonable
and moderate plan; without giving up
any one of the rights claimed by this country,
except that of altering their charters and disposing
of their property.—And, as it would have restored
peace and prevented the desolating calamities
into which <i>America</i> and <i>Britain</i> are now
plunged, no friend to humanity can avoid regretting
that such a plan, when offered, was not
adopted. But our rulers preferred coercion and
conquest: And the consequence has been, that
the Colonies, after being goaded and irritated to
the utmost, resolved to disengage themselves, and
directed the <span class="smcap">Congress</span> to declare them Independent
States; which was accordingly done, as
is well-known, on the 4th of July last. Since
that time, they have, probably, been making applications
to foreign powers; and it is to be
feared, that <i>now</i> we may in vain offer them the very
terms for which they once sued.—All this is the
necessary consequence of the principles by which
human nature is governed.—There was a time
when, perhaps, we should ourselves have acted
with more violence; and, instead of remonstrating
and praying, as <i>America</i> has done, have refused
the most advantageous terms when offered
with defiance, and under an awe from a military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_86" id="Page_2_86">[86]</a></span>
force. Had King <span class="smcap">William</span>, instead of coming
over by invitation to deliver us, invaded us; and,
at the head of an army, offered us the <span class="smcap">Bill of
Rights</span>; we should, perhaps, have spurned at
it; and considered <span class="smcap">Liberty</span> itself as no better
than <span class="smcap">Slavery</span>, when enjoyed as a boon from an
insolent conqueror.—But we have all along
acted as if we thought the people of <i>America</i> did
not possess the feelings and passions of <i>men</i>,
much less of <i>Englishmen</i>.—It is indeed strange
our ministers did not long ago see, that they had
mistaken the proper method of treating the Colonies;
and that though they might be gradually
<i>influenced</i> to any thing, they could be dragooned
to nothing.—Had King <i>James the Second</i> avoided
violence; and been a little more patient and secret
in pursuing his views, he might have gained
all he wished for. But an eager haste and an
open avowal of the odious claims of prerogative
ruined him.—This has been since considered;
and a plan both here and in <i>Ireland</i>,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> less <i>expeditious</i>
indeed, but more <i>sure</i>, has been pursued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_87" id="Page_2_87">[87]</a></span>
And had the same plan been pursued in <i>America</i>,
the whole empire might in time have been
brought, without a struggle, to rest itself quietly
in the lap of corruption and slavery. It may,
therefore, in the issue prove happy to the Colonies,
that they have not been thought worthy of
any such cautious treatment. Our coercive measures
have done all for them that their warmest
patriots could have desired. They have united
them among themselves, and bound them together
under one government. They have checked
them in the career of vicious luxury; guarded
them against any farther infection from hence;
taught them to seek all their resources within
themselves; instructed them in the use of arms;
and led them to form a naval and military power
which may, perhaps, in time, become superior to
any force that can attack them, and prove the
means of preserving from invasion and violence, a
government of justice and virtue, to which the
oppressed in every quarter of the globe may fly,
and find peace, protection, and liberty.—In
short. These measures have, in all probability,
hastened that disruption of the <i>new</i> from the <i>old</i>
world, which will begin a new <i>æra</i> in the annals
of mankind;<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and produce a revolution more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_88" id="Page_2_88">[88]</a></span>
important, perhaps, than any that has happened
in human affairs.—As a friend, therefore, to
the general interest of mankind, I ought, probably,
to rejoice in these measures; and to bless
that all-governing Providence, which, often, out
of the evil intended by wretched mortals, brings
the greatest good.—But when I consider the
<i>present</i> sufferings which these measures must occasion,
and the <i>catastrophe</i> with which they threaten
<span class="smcap">Great-Britain</span>; I am shocked; and feel myself
incapable of looking forward, without distress,
to the fate of an empire, once united and happy,
but now torn to pieces, and falling a sacrifice to
despotic violence and blindness. Under the impressions
of these sentiments, and dreading the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_89" id="Page_2_89">[89]</a></span>
awful <i>crisis</i> before us, I cannot help, however impotent
my voice, crying out to this country—“Make
no longer war against <i>yourselves</i>. Withdraw
your armies from your Colonies. Offer
your power to them as a <i>protecting</i>, not a <i>destroying</i>
power. Grant the security they desire
to their property and charters; and renounce
those notions of dignity, which lead you to prefer
the exactions of force to the offerings of
gratitude, and to hazard <i>every thing</i> to gain
<i>nothing</i>.—By such wisdom and equity <i>America</i>
may, perhaps, be still preserved; and that
dreadful breach healed, which your enemies
are viewing with triumph, and all <i>Europe</i> with
astonishment.”</p>

<p>But what am I doing?—At the moment
I am writing this, the possibility of a reconciliation
may be lost.—<i>America</i> may have formed
an alliance with <span class="smcap">France</span>—And the die may be
cast.</p>

<h3 id="II_PART_II_SECT_III">SECT. III.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of Schemes for raising Money by Public Loans.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The following observations were occasioned
by the scheme for the public loan of last
year, proposed to the <i>House of Commons</i> at opening
the <i>Budget</i>, and afterwards agreed to. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_90" id="Page_2_90">[90]</a></span>
thought proper, therefore, to introduce these
observations here; and, as they appear to me of
some importance, I shall endeavour to explain
them with as much care and perspicuity as
possible.</p>

<p class="tb">In order to raise <i>two millions</i>, the Legislature
created last year a new capital in the 3 <i>per
cent.</i> consolidated annuities, of 2.150,000l. Every
share of 77l. 10s. in this new capital was valued
at 65l. 17s. 6d. or every 100l. <i>stock</i> at
85l. For the whole new capital, therefore, Government
has received in money, 1.827,500l.—The
remaining sum, necessary to make up <i>two
millions</i>, was a compensation advanced to Government
for relinquishing the profits of a Lottery,
consisting of 60,000 tickets, each of the same value
with 10l. <i>three per cent. stock</i>; and might have
been obtained, without annexing the Lottery to
the annuities.—This new capital the public
may be obliged to redeem at <i>par</i>; in which
case, 322,500l. (being the difference between
1.827,500 and 2.150,000l.) that is 17½ <i>per
cent.</i> will be paid by the public more than it has
received.—In this transaction, therefore, Government
has acted as a private person would act,
who, in order to raise 850l. on a mortgage,
should promise for it 30l. <i>per ann.</i> (or 3½ <i>per
cent.</i> interest) and 150l. (that is 17½ <i>per cent</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_91" id="Page_2_91">[91]</a></span>
nearly) over and above the principal, when the
mortgage came to be discharged.—Such a
<i>premium</i> (should the mortgage be discharged soon)
would be very extravagant; but, if <i>never</i> to be
discharged, would be insignificant: Nor would it
be possible to account for such a bargain, except
by supposing, that the borrower, instead of meaning
to repay the sum he borrowed, chose to continue
<i>always</i> paying interest for it, or returning
30l. annually for 850l. once advanced; and to
subject his estate, for that purpose, to an eternal
incumbrance.</p>

<p>The public, I have said, may be obliged to
discharge the new capital, lately created, at <i>par</i>;
and, consequently, to suffer a loss by this year’s
loan of 322,500l. This will, undoubtedly, happen,
should the nation prosper, and the public
debts be put into a regular and fixed course of
redemption; for the 3 <i>per cents.</i> would then soon
rise to <i>par</i>.</p>

<p>The extravagance I have pointed out is the
more to be regretted, because it was entirely
needless; for the same sum might as well have
been borrowed by schemes, which would not have
subjected the public to the necessity of paying,
when the loan came to be discharged, more
money than had been received.—For instance.
The sum advanced for the new capital of
2.150,000l. <i>three per cent.</i> annuities, might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_92" id="Page_2_92">[92]</a></span>
been procured by offering 3½ <i>per cent.</i> on a capital
equal to the sum advanced; or on 1.827,500l.
And the remainder, necessary to make up <i>two millions</i>,
might have been obtained by the profits of a
Lottery, consisting of 60,000 tickets each worth
10l. in <span class="smcap">Money</span>. This scheme would have differed
but little in value from the other; and the
interest, or the annuity payable by the public,
would have been 63,962l. at 3½ <i>per cent.</i> on a
capital of 1.827,500l.;<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> instead of 64,500l. at
3 <i>per cent.</i> on a capital of 2.150,000l.</p>

<p>When a 100l. <i>stock</i> in the 3 <i>per cent.</i> annuities is
sold at 85¾, purchasers get 3½ <i>per cent.</i> interest
for their money. When, therefore, the 3 <i>per
cents</i> are at this price, 3½ <i>per cents</i> would be at
<i>par</i>; and a capital of 1.827,500l. might be redeemed
by the public, (without losing any advantage
arising from its debts being at a discount,)
by paying this sum; or by returning the money
borrowed<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. But in the same circumstances, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_93" id="Page_2_93">[93]</a></span>
capital of 2.150,000l. in the 3 <i>per cent.</i> annuities,
for which 85l. <i>per cent.</i> or, in the whole,
1.827,500l. had been received, could not be redeemed
without offering 86 or 87 <i>per cent.</i> for it;
nor, therefore, without paying <i>more</i> than the original
sum borrowed.—When the 3 <i>per cents</i>
are near <i>par</i>, there would be a loss of 322,500l.
in redeeming the same capital; whereas, the former
annuities, for which the same sum had been
advanced, might be always discharged by either
paying the very sum<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> advanced, or a <i>less sum</i>.—In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_94" id="Page_2_94">[94]</a></span>
all possible circumstances, therefore, these
annuities would have the advantage.—But we
never, when contracting debts, carry our views
to the discharge of the principal; and the consequences
must prove fatal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_95" id="Page_2_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb">It is necessary I should observe, in justice to our
present ministers, that in adapting the scheme on
which I have made these remarks, they have only
followed the example of former ministers; and
that, however needless a waste it occasions of
public money, there is reason to fear it will be
followed by future ministers; for the increase of
difficulty and expence in redeeming the public
debts, which such schemes create, being to be
felt <i>hereafter</i>, it makes no impression, and is little
regarded.</p>

<p class="tb">In 1759, the fifth year of the last war, the
lenders of 6.600,000l. were granted a capital in
the 3 <i>per cents</i> of 7.590,000l. together with the
profits of the Lottery. Subtract from the sum
advanced, 150,000l. for the profits of the Lottery;
and it will appear, that, in this instance, 1.140,000l.
was <i>needlessly</i> added to the capital; there being no
reason to doubt, but that lenders would then have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_96" id="Page_2_96">[96]</a></span>
readily advanced 6.600,000l. for a capital of
6.450,000l. bearing 3½ <i>per cent.</i><a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> interest,
provided the profits of a Lottery were annexed;
instead of advancing the same sum for a nominal
capital near 18 <i>per cent.</i> greater, but bearing 3
<i>per cent.</i> interest.</p>

<p class="tb">Again. In 1762, in order to raise 12 millions,
every contributor of 80l. was entitled to a capital
of 100l. to bear 4 <i>per cent.</i> interest for 19
years; and afterwards to become redeemable, and
to bear interest at 3 <i>per cent.</i> And for the remaining
20l. necessary to make up a 100l. contributors
were entitled to an annuity of 1l. for
98 years.—This was the same with promising,
for every 60l. advanced, a 100l. capital in the 3
<i>per cent.</i> annuities, not redeemable for 19 years;
and, for the remaining 40l. necessary to make up
100l. an annuity of 2l. for 19 years; and, after
that, of 1l. for 79 years.</p>

<p>By this scheme no less a sum than 4.800,000l.
was needlessly added to the capital of the public
debts. For, had 5 <i>per cent.</i> been offered for
every 60l. advanced;<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and, for the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_97" id="Page_2_97">[97]</a></span>
40l. an annuity of 2l. during 19 years,
and afterwards of 1l. for 79 years; equal encouragement
would have been given to contributors;
the annuity payable by the public would
have been the same; and the new capital would
have been 7.200,000l. bearing 5 <i>per cent.</i> interest;
which might, at any time, have been redeemed with
a saving of a million <i>per ann.</i> (the first payment
to be made immediately) in <i>five</i> years and a <i>quarter</i>:
Whereas now, this debt will not become redeemable
till 1781; and then, it will form a capital
of 12 millions, not capable of being redeemed
with the same saving, in less than <i>nine</i>
years and a half. Five millions and a quarter,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
therefore, will be wasted.</p>

<p>The capital of 12 millions four <i>per cent.</i> annuities
created this year, were made irredeemable for 19
years, to guard against the effects of an apprehension
then unavoidable, that an interest of 4 <i>per
cent.</i> would, if the capitals were redeemable, be
reduced, whenever peace came, to 3 <i>per cent.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_98" id="Page_2_98">[98]</a></span>
as had been done in the preceding peace.—But this
end would have been answered, with equal effect
and more advantage to the public, by pledging the
faith of Parliament, that whatever interest was
promised on any capital, should not be <i>reduced</i>
for 19 years; or (which comes to the same) that
the capital should not be <i>redeemed</i>, during that
term, by borrowing money, and creating a new
capital bearing <i>lower</i> interest. This would have
placed capitals bearing any interest on the same
footing <i>nearly</i> with the 3 <i>per cent.</i> annuities; and
an assurance, that no part of them should be discharged,
without at the same time discharging an
equal capital in the 3 <i>per cents</i>, would have placed
them <i>entirely</i> on the same footing.—Had it,
however, been necessary, on account of the fear
of a reduction of interest, to make the capital
here proposed bearing 5 <i>per cent</i>, and the capitals
to be mentioned presently bearing 4 <i>per cent.</i>
irredeemable, (and therefore the interest irreducible)
for any term (suppose till 1781); had,
I say, even this been necessary (and more could
not have been necessary) no advantage of great
consequence would have been lost. These capitals
would, during that term, have been exactly the
same burden on the public with the capitals which
were actually created; and after that term, they
would have been a much less burden, as will be
shewn at the end of this section.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_99" id="Page_2_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Again. In January 1760, eight millions were
borrowed by offering for this sum a capital of
eight millions to carry 4 <i>per cent.</i> interest for 21
years, and afterwards 3 <i>per cent</i>, together with a
<i>premium</i> of 240,000l. stock carrying the same interest,
and divided into 80,000l. lottery tickets,
each 3l. stock.—This was the same with offering,
for 80l. of every 100l. advanced, a capital
of 100l. in the 3 <i>per cent.</i> annuities,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
not redeemable for 21 years; and for
the remainder besides a lottery ticket an annuity
of 1l. for 21 years.—The same sum
might have been raised by offering 4 <i>per cent</i>,
irreducible during 21 years, or 3l. <i>per ann.</i> for
75l. of every 100l. advanced, and for the remaining
25l. an annuity of 1l. for 21 years,
together with a lottery ticket.—In this case,
the new capital, instead of 8.240,000l. bearing 3
<i>per cent.</i> not subject to redemption, and having an
annuity of 82,400l. annexed to it, for 21 years;
would have been 6.000,000l. bearing 4 <i>per cent.</i> with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_100" id="Page_2_100">[100]</a></span>
the same annuity annexed, but redeemable at <i>any</i>
time; and 240,000<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> bearing 4 <i>per cent.</i> for
21 years, and afterwards 3 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p>By the scheme likewise in 1761, for borrowing
11.400,000<i>l.</i> a capital of 100<i>l.</i> bearing
3 <i>per cent. interest</i>, was given for part of every
100<i>l.</i> advanced; and for the other part, an annuity
of 1<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for 99 years. Had, in this
case, 75<i>l.</i> FOUR <i>per cent.</i> <span class="smcap">Stock</span>, been offered for
75<i>l.</i> in <i>money</i>; and, for the remaining 25<i>l.</i> necessary
to make up 100<i>l.</i> the said annuity of
1<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for 99 years;<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> the whole annual
charge would have been the same; subscribers
could not have been sensible of any difference in
the encouragement offered them; and the public,
in paying its debts, would have saved 2.850,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>There was also this year 600,000<i>l.</i> received by
government for 600,000<i>l.</i> stock, carrying 3 <i>per
cent.</i> interest, and divided into 60,000 lottery
tickets, each worth 10<i>l.</i> in stock.—As 150,000<i>l.</i>
of this sum was paid for the profits of the lottery;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_101" id="Page_2_101">[101]</a></span>
and as 4 <i>per cent.</i> could not at this time be made
of money laid out in the funds, it is out of doubt,
that the same sum (or 600,000<i>l.</i>) would have
been given for 450,000<i>l.</i> stock, carrying 4 <i>per
cent.</i> and divided into 60,000 lottery tickets, each
of the same value with 7<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> four <i>per cent.</i> stock;
and thus 150,000<i>l.</i> more would have been saved.</p>

<p>In like manner; it will appear, that <i>three millions</i>,
raised in 1757, by creating a capital of <i>three
millions</i> bearing 3 <i>per cent.</i> interest,<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> with a life
annuity annexed of 1<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for every 100<i>l.</i>
advanced; and also, <i>four millions and a half</i> raised
in 1758, by creating a capital of <i>four millions and
a half</i>, bearing 3 <i>per cent.</i> with an annuity of a <i>half
per cent.</i> annexed for 24 years; might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_102" id="Page_2_102">[102]</a></span>
raised by creating, in the former case, a capital of
two millions and a half, and, in the latter, a
capital of four millions, bearing 3½ <i>per cent.</i> interest,
with the same annuities annexed.</p>

<p>In 1758, the additional sum of half a million
was borrowed at 3 <i>per cent.</i> by a lottery, consisting
of 50,000 tickets, each of the same real value
with 10l. <i>stock</i>, but sold to the subscribers for 10l.
in <i>money</i><a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. As the 3 <i>per cents.</i> were now at 94,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_103" id="Page_2_103">[103]</a></span>
3¼ <i>per cent.</i> could not be made of money laid out
in the funds. Therefore, 350,000<i>l.</i> of this half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_104" id="Page_2_104">[104]</a></span>
million might have been raised at 3½ <i>per cent.</i>
interest, and the remaining 150,000<i>l.</i> might have
been procured for the profits of the lottery. Or
(which is the same) 10<i>l.</i> each would have been
given for 50,000 tickets, of the same value taken
all together, with 350,000l. carrying 3½ <i>per cent.</i>
interest; and a capital of 150,000<i>l.</i> would have
been saved.</p>

<p>The same is true of the lottery, by which half
a million was borrowed in 1756.—A million
and a half also borrowed in this year, by creating
a capital of a million and a half, bearing 3½ <i>per
cent.</i> for 15 years, and afterwards 3 <i>per cent.</i>
might have been procured, by creating a capital
of only 1.400,000<i>l.</i> bearing 3¼ <i>per cent.</i> interest.
But I will not examine any more of these loans.
Let us next consider how detrimental they have
been to the public.</p>

<p class="tb">All the savings and surplus monies of the
kingdom from 1763 to 1775, have amounted
(deducting 400,000<i>l.</i> gained by debts discharged
at a discount) to 10.739,793<i>l.</i> and with this sum
11.139,793<i>l.</i> of the national debt has been paid
off. (See the <i>Postscript</i> at the end of this work.)—The
needless addition which was made to
the capital of the national debt, by injudicious
schemes for raising money during the last war,
exceeded this sum; and it follows, therefore, that
the whole surplus of the revenue for twelve years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_105" id="Page_2_105">[105]</a></span>
has not been sufficient to discharge the capital,
to which in the last war a right was given, without
receiving any money for it, or obtaining the
least advantage by it.</p>

<p>The attentive reader must have observed, as I
have gone along, that the extravagance on which
I have insisted, has been the consequence of not
separating, in the schemes for raising money, the
premiums (consisting of short and long and life-annuities)
from the perpetual annuities, and requiring
them to be distinctly paid for; and also,
of not attending to the difference between selling
an <i>annuity</i>, and selling the <i>stock</i> for which that
annuity is paid. When a 100<i>l.</i> <i>stock</i> in the 3 <i>per
cents.</i> is at any given price, there is no one who
would not be glad to purchase from government
a perpetual annuity of 3<i>l.</i> at any <i>lower</i> price<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.
But when government sells the <i>stock</i>, instead of the
<i>annuity</i>, at that price, the public is injured in the
manner I have represented.</p>

<p>Would any one, in selling any part of his property,
offer to make the purchase-money an outstanding
principal which he shall be bound to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_106" id="Page_2_106">[106]</a></span>
return?<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> This is what government has uniformly
done in its proposals for raising money.—Were I
to desire any sum to be lent me <i>without</i> interest,
offering as a <i>compensation</i> or <i>premium</i> an annuity
for a given term, or an advantageous contract;
the proposal would not be accepted, unless the
annuity or the contract was worth the sum to be
lent; and I should make myself a debtor to the
purchaser for the very thing which I sold to him.—The
absurdity would be the same, if instead
of borrowing <i>without</i> interest, I should in the
same way borrow at a <i>low</i> interest. In every such
bargain, I should bring upon myself a needless
debt, equal to the value of the <i>premium</i>.</p>

<p>I am afraid I have tired my reader’s attention
on this subject. But as much depends upon a
right understanding of it, I am anxious about
shewing it in every possible light. In hopes,
therefore, of being attended to a little longer, I
shall endeavour to give a yet fuller view of this
subject, and to prove its importance, by recapitulating
some of the foregoing remarks, and comparing
the <i>present</i> state of our public debts, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_107" id="Page_2_107">[107]</a></span>
that which would have been their state, had the
errors I have pointed out, in the schemes of the
public loans during the last war, been avoided.</p>

<p class="tb">The sum of 12 millions, borrowed in 1762,
would have left, at the end of the war, a redeemable
capital of 7.200,000l. carrying 5 <i>per cent.</i> interest,
with an annuity added of 120,000l. for 18 years
from January 1763, instead of an <i>ir</i>-redeemable
capital of 12 millions carrying 4 <i>per cent.</i> for 18
years, and afterwards 3 <i>per cent.</i> See <a href="#Page_2_95">page 95, &amp;c.</a></p>

<p>The sum of 12 millions, borrowed in 1761,
would have left a redeemable capital of 9 millions
bearing 4 <i>per cent.</i> interest, with a long annuity
annexed; instead of 12 millions with the same annuity
annexed. <a href="#Page_2_100">Page 100.</a></p>

<p>The sum of 8 millions, borrowed in 1760,
would have left a redeemable capital of 6.180,000l.
carrying 4 <i>per cent.</i> with an annuity of 82,400l.
for 18 years from January 1763; instead of
8.240,000l. <i>ir</i>-redeemable, and carrying 4 <i>per cent.</i>
for 18 years, and afterwards 3 <i>per cent.</i> <a href="#Page_2_99">Page 99.</a></p>

<p>The sum of 6.600,000l. borrowed in 1759,
would have left a capital of 6.450,000l. carrying
3½ <i>per cent</i>; instead of a capital of 7.590,000l.
carrying 3 <i>per cent.</i> <a href="#Page_2_95">Page 95.</a></p>

<p>The sum of five millions, borrowed in 1758,
would have left a redeemable capital of 4.350,000l.
bearing 3½ <i>per cent.</i> interest, with an annuity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_108" id="Page_2_108">[108]</a></span>
added of 22,500l. for 19 years from Midsummer
1763; instead of a capital of five millions irredeemable,
and carrying 3½ <i>per cent.</i> for 19 years,
and afterwards 3 <i>per cent.</i> <a href="#Page_2_101">Page 101, 102, &amp;c.</a></p>

<p>The sum of three millions, borrowed in 1757,
would have left a capital of two millions and a
half bearing 3½ <i>per cent.</i> interest, instead of three
millions bearing 3 <i>per cent.</i> interest.—And two
millions, borrowed in 1756, instead of leaving a
capital of two millions, would have left a capital
of only 1.750,000l. <a href="#Page_2_104">Page 104.</a></p>

<p>The result, therefore, is, that the whole capital
of the public debts would have been, at the
end of the last war, near <span class="smcap">Twelve Millions and
a Half</span> less than it was; and at the same time,
the annual charge not greater.—In 1775, the
difference would have been much more considerable.
For,</p>

<p>Supposing all the same sums applied since the
last war to the discharge of the public debts that
we know have been so applied, not only the <i>capital</i>
but the <i>annual charge</i> would have been considerably
less.—This will be demonstrated by the
following account.</p>

<p>It may be learnt from the <i>Postscript</i> at the
end of this Tract, that 11.139,793l. of the public
debts has been discharged with 10.739,793l.
of the public money, derived from various savings
and surplusses. All this money <i>might</i> have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_109" id="Page_2_109">[109]</a></span>
employed, and without doubt <i>would</i> have been
employed, in redeeming first the capital I have
mentioned in <a href="#Page_2_107">Page 107</a>, of 7.200,000l. bearing
5 <i>per cent.</i> interest; and afterwards, the
two other capitals there mentioned of 9 millions,
and of 6.180,000l. bearing 4 <i>per cent.</i> interest.
It would have been sufficient to redeem
the whole of the former capital, and also
3.539,793l. of the two last capitals; which would
have set free for the public an annual charge of
501,591l.—To this sum must be added an annual
charge of 256,000l. saved in 1765, 1766,
1767 and 1768, by redeeming, with 6.400,000l.
borrowed in those years, so much of a debt unfunded
at the end of the war, but afterwards
funded, and carrying 4 <i>per cent.</i> interest. And
also 12,537l. <i>per ann.</i> gained by changing
1.253,700l. from an interest of 4 to 3 <i>per cent.</i>
and 7,500l. <i>per ann.</i> gained in 1771, by the ceasing
of an annuity of a ½ <i>per cent.</i> annexed for 15 years
to 1.500,000l. borrowed in 1756.—The total
decrease, therefore, of the annual charge would
have been 777,628l.—But at the same time
there would have been the following additions to
it.—First. There would have been the addition
of 199,500l. <i>per ann.</i> being the interest of
6.650,000l. borrowed since 1763.—Secondly.
Of 69,187l. <i>per ann.</i> being the interest of
2.306,240l. applied, in 1764 and 1765, to the discharge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_110" id="Page_2_110">[110]</a></span>
of German and army debts derived from
the war, and which might have been converted
into a funded capital bearing 3 <i>per cent.</i> interest,
by borrowing money to pay them off, in order to
avoid diverting money employed in redeeming capitals
bearing 5 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p>These two sums make 268,687l. which deducted
from 777,628l. leaves 508,941l. And
this is the clear annual charge which would have
been saved to the public, exclusive of the savings
which have arisen from the falling in of life-annuities.</p>

<p>But the annual charge that has in fact been
saved is only 382,129<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.—The difference is
126,812l.—With this additional saving, as it
fell in and increased from time to time during the
course of 12 years, a million more of the public
debts bearing 4 <i>per cent.</i> might have been redeemed;
and this would have made a farther
saving of 40,000l. <i>per ann.</i> It appears, therefore,
upon the whole, that had the mistakes I
have pointed out, in the loans of the last war, been
avoided, (all other public measures remaining the
same) the nation would <i>now</i> have had 13 millions
and a half less to pay, in order to redeem its debts;
and also an annual charge upon it 166,812l. less.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_111" id="Page_2_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>All this supposes that the capitals of the 5 <i>per
cent.</i> and 4 <i>per cent.</i> annuities in the improved
schemes were redeemable.—But had they been made
irredeemable till 1781, as mentioned in <a href="#Page_2_98">page 98</a>,
the public would not have been much less benefited:
For, soon after 1781, these 5 and 4 <i>per
cents.</i> (the former 7.200,000l. and the latter
15.180,000l.) might have been easily reduced to
3½ <i>per cent.</i> and this would have occasioned an
annual saving of 183,900l. over and above the
savings, which would have arisen in that year, from
the extinction of the short annuities.</p>

<p>I will add, that had these annuities been made
not only <i>irredeemable</i> till 1781; but <i>irreducible</i> for
some time beyond that year, in the manner intimated
in <a href="#Page_2_98">page 98</a>, the public would still have
been greatly benefited. For, the annual charge
upon it would not at any time have been greater;
but its debts would have been 12 millions and a
half less; and, at the same time, they would have
been capable of being discharged with more expedition,
and at a less expence, than a smaller
quantity of its present debts. See the note, <a href="#Page_2_94">page 94</a>.</p>

<p class="tb">I cannot doubt but that all who will attentively
examine these observations will find them to be
just.—I have confined my enquiries to the loans
of the last war. Had I extended them to all our
loans, it would have appeared, that a greater sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_112" id="Page_2_112">[112]</a></span>
than most persons can think credible,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> has been
such a needless addition to our debts as I have explained;
or, “a pure and uncompensated loss,
which might have been avoided by only framing
differently the schemes of the public loans.”</p>

<p>This <span class="smcap">Abstract</span> has been formed from the accounts
delivered annually to the <span class="smcap">House of Commons</span>,
and lately published by Sir <span class="smcap">Charles
Whitworth</span>.</p>

<p>In order to draw just inferences from it, the
following particulars should be remembered.—First.
The <span class="smcap">Exports</span> in the <i>Custom-House</i> entries
are, for reasons well-known, too high. This excess
has, by some of the best judges, been reckoned
at a million <i>per ann.</i>—Secondly. The <span class="smcap">Imports</span>
are too low, no smuggled commodities being included
in them. This deficiency has been estimated
at another million <i>per ann.</i> But, in order
to be sure of keeping within bounds, I will take
both at a <i>million and a half per ann.</i>—Thirdly.
The interest of the national debt paid to foreigners;
the money spent in foreign countries by <i>English</i>
travellers; the bullion consumed in manufactures;
and the wear of the current coin, cannot, perhaps,
amount to much less than two millions <i>per ann.</i>
I will, however, take them at no more than the
annual sum which has been commonly supposed to
be due to foreigners from our funds; or, a <i>million
and a half</i>.—In order, therefore, to find the
<span class="smcap">Grand Balance of Payment</span> between <i>Britain</i>
and the rest of the world <i>since</i> the last war, all
these sums (making up <span class="smcap">Three Millions</span>)
must be deducted from the excess of the exports.—But,
in order to find the same balance <i>before</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_115" id="Page_2_115">[115]</a></span>
the end of the last war, less must be deducted, in
proportion as the national debt and the foreign
trade were <i>then</i> less than they are <i>now</i>.</p>

<p>If the foregoing Abstract is examined with a
due regard to this rule, it will be found that, from<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
1710 to 1764, the <span class="smcap">Balance of Payment</span>
must have been in favour of <i>Britain</i>; and that
consequently, there must have been, during that
period, an influx of money into the kingdom.—It
was this, together with the increase of our
paper, that produced the rapid fall of interest
which began a few years before the <i>Accession</i>. And
it was this also that enabled us to bear the great
expence of the two last wars, and the loss of those
enormous sums which were sent out of the kingdom
to pay foreign subsidies, and to support armies
on the continent.</p>

<p>Before 1710 it appears to be doubtful, whether
the excess of the exports was such as brought any
money into the kingdom; but it seems certain,
that it could not have been such as in any degree
compensated that drain of the public cash, which
was occasioned by the continental wars of King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_116" id="Page_2_116">[116]</a></span>
<i>William</i> and Queen <i>Ann</i>. In consequence of this,
the quantity of <i>specie</i> in the kingdom must have
been greatly diminished; and Dr. <i>Davenant</i> computes
that in 1711 it was nine millions less than
at the <i>Revolution</i>. Hence proceeded the high
rate of interest; the unproductiveness of the taxes;
and the difficulties which government met with in
raising money during those two wars: And there
is reason to believe, these difficulties would have
been insurmountable, had not a substitute for
<i>specie</i> been provided by the establishment of the
<i>Bank</i>.</p>

<p>In the interval of peace between the two last
wars, or from 1748 to 1755, the balance in favour
of <i>Britain</i> was at the highest; and this contributed
to raise the stocks<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> to such a price, as
enabled government to reduce the interest of the
public debts from 4 to 3 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p>But the observation I here intended principally
to make is, that the <i>balance</i>, since the year 1764,
appears, from the preceding abstract, to have
been <i>against</i> <span class="smcap">Britain</span>; and that this accounts for
the high price of bullion, the scarcity of specie,
and the distress of the <i>Bank</i> from that year to
1773.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_117" id="Page_2_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>It deserves farther to be observed that, while
the exports were decreasing from 1764 to 1773,
the <span class="smcap">Imports</span> appear to have increased faster than
ever: And the fact is, that since 1760, a greater addition
has been made to them, than had been
made during the whole time from the <i>Accession</i> to
that year.—This is a striking proof that luxury
has been for some years increasing with rapidity
among us; and it is worth adding, that the productiveness
of the taxes has kept pace, as might
have been expected, with this increase of luxury,
both the <span class="smcap">Customs</span> and <span class="smcap">Excises</span> having brought
in lately, near 250,000l. <i>per ann.</i> each, more
than they did twelve years ago.—It should be
attended to, that this improvement of the revenue
must be the effect solely of an increased consumption
occasioned by luxury; the taxes, ever since
the end of the last war, having been nearly the
same.</p>

<p>The <i>exports</i> from 1710 to 1764 went on increasing
constantly. I have observed, that from 1764
to 1773 they have decreased. One reason of this
has been, the decline of the <span class="smcap">Portugal</span> trade;
the exports to that country having fallen, since
1760, from 1.200,000l. <i>per ann.</i> to 600,000l. <i>per
ann.</i>—Another reason has been the check which
a wretched policy has been giving, ever since 1763,
to our trade with the Colonies. This trade had
for many years contributed more than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_118" id="Page_2_118">[118]</a></span>
other trade towards raising our <i>exports</i>; and even
in the period between 1763 and 1774, notwithstanding
the checks it received, it went on increasing,
and produced a balance in our favour
of a million and a half <i>per ann.</i> But since 1774 it
has been entirely lost. <i>Before</i> this loss, the balance
of payment between us and the rest of the
world was, according to the account I have
given, <i>against</i> us. Undoubtedly then, it was
a loss we could by no means have sustained, had
it not been for the seasonable interposition of some
very particular causes. Time will shew whether
these causes are of a permanent nature, or temporary
and accidental.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (1)—<span class="smcap">Bank Old Capital</span>. See <a href="#Page_2_119">Page 119</a>.—The
<span class="smcap">Bank</span> was established in 1694. Their original
capital was 1.200,000<i>l.</i> bearing 8 <i>per cent.</i> interest, charged
on 5/7ths. of 9<i>d.</i> <i>per</i> barrel excise, with 4000<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i> for
management.—In 1709, they lent to government 400,000<i>l.</i>
without interest, which increased their old capital to 1.600,000<i>l.</i>
bearing 6 <i>per cent.</i> interest. In 1742, they again lent to
government 1.600,000l. without interest; and thereby increased
this capital to its present amount, or to 3.200,000<i>l.</i>
bearing 3 <i>per cent.</i> with the same annual sum for management.—It
is of particular importance to observe with respect
to the sums of 400,000<i>l.</i> and of 1.600,000<i>l.</i> just mentioned,
that they were properly a compensation from the <i>Bank</i> to the
public for continuing their exclusive privileges; and would
have been advanced, or at least the greatest part of them,
though government had not bound itself to return the purchase
money, by making it a part of the principal due to the <i>Bank</i>,
provided the same interest had been continued for some time on
their former principal, and the same liberty granted to increase
their <i>stock</i>.—The like is true of 1.200,000<i>l.</i> advanced by the
<i>India</i> Company without interest in 1708.—In these instances,
therefore, a needless addition was made to the public debt of
3.200,000<i>l.</i> which, had it been avoided, the public would have
had not only a principal so much less to pay; but it would have
saved in interest at least 96000<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i> for the old capital of
the <i>Bank</i> and the capital of the <i>East India</i> Company would have
formed, in this case, between them, a debt of only 3.200,000<i>l.</i>
(instead of 6.400,000<i>l.</i>) the interest of which might long ago
have been reduced at least one half; or from 8 <i>per cent.</i> the
original interest, to 4 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (2)—<i>Half a million</i>, part of the <span class="smcap">Bank Capital</span>.
See <a href="#Page_2_119">Page 119</a>.—This part of the Bank capital consisted
originally of two millions in <i>Exchequer</i> bills, cancelled for government
by an act of the 3d of <i>Geo.</i> I. But half a million
was discharged in 1729; and a million in 1738.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (3)—<span class="smcap">Four millions</span> purchased of the <span class="smcap">South-Sea
Company</span>; part of the <span class="smcap">Bank</span> Capital. See <a href="#Page_2_119">Page 119</a>.—In
order to procure this money, the <i>Bank</i> sold new stock
at 18 <i>per cent.</i> premium. This produced a saving of 610,169<i>l.</i>
the sale of 3.389,831<i>l.</i> <i>stock</i> having produced four millions in
<i>money</i>. And, consequently, though by this transaction the
capital for which they received interest was increased four
millions, yet the <i>stock</i> on which they made their dividends
was increased only 3.389,831<i>l.</i></p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (4)—<span class="smcap">Bank Stock</span> and <span class="smcap">Dividend</span>.—The
<i>stock</i> on which the <i>Bank</i> divides is only 10,780,000<i>l.</i> This
dividend varies as their profits vary; but for several years
it has been 5½ <i>per cent.</i> payable half-yearly at <i>Lady-day</i>
and <i>Michaelmas</i>. Their whole annual dividend is, therefore,
592,900<i>l.</i> which subtracted from 350,604<i>l.</i> the interest
paid by government, makes their clear annual profit 242,296<i>l.</i>—Besides
interest, they receive for management of their
capital 4000<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i> on account of their old capital, and
1,898<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i> on account of four millions purchased of the
South Sea Company; in all, 5,898<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i>—The <i>Bank</i>
receives farther the sums specified in the foregoing account,
towards bearing the expences of managing the annuities commonly
called <i>Bank Annuities</i>. All these expences, including the
sums granted for managing their capital, amount to 54,645<i>l.</i>
<i>per ann.</i></p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (5)—<span class="smcap">Consolidated</span> 4 <i>per cent.</i> <span class="smcap">Bank Annuities</span>.
See <a href="#Page_2_120">Page 120</a>.—The capital of these Annuities
consists of two loans, one in 1760, and the other in 1762, consolidated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_127" id="Page_2_127">[127]</a></span>
into one stock, and charged on the additional duty
of 3<i>d.</i> per bushel on malt, the surplus of the duties on spirituous
liquors, and the additional duties on windows; all which duties
were ordered by 2d Geo. III. to be carried to the Sinking Fund,
and the interest with which they were charged to be paid out of
that fund.—I have made some remarks on these loans in
<a href="#Page_2_96">page 96</a>, and <a href="#Page_2_99">page 99</a>. They amounted to 20.240,000<i>l.</i> But
1.253,700<i>l.</i> of this capital was changed in 1770, from an
interest of 4 to 3 <i>per cent.</i> and the capital reduced to the
present sum.—A more full account of these annuities may
be found in Mr. <i>Ashmore</i>’s Analysis of the several Bank
Annuities, p. 17.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (6)—<span class="smcap">Consolidated</span> 3 <i>per cent.</i> <span class="smcap">Bank Annuities</span>.
See <a href="#Page_2_121">page 121</a>.—The capital of these annuities is made
a distinct stock from that of the annuities called <i>Reduced</i>, because
it never bore a higher interest than 3 <i>per cent.</i>—It consisted originally
of the following loans—37,821<i>l.</i> remaining in 1727, of
3 <i>per cent.</i> annuities, granted in lieu of St. <i>Christopher</i>’s and
<i>Nevis</i> debentures—800,000<i>l.</i> borrowed in 1731—600,000<i>l.</i>
borrowed in 1736—300,000<i>l</i>. in 1738—6.400,000<i>l</i>. in
1742, 1743, 1744 and 1745, and charged on additional duties
on spirituous liquors, wines, vinegar, &amp;c.—1.000,000<i>l.</i>
borrowed in 1750—24.490,000<i>l.</i> borrowed in the course of
the last war, and funded on the additional duties on beer,
houses, stamps, &amp;c.—4.900,000<i>l.</i> borrowed in 1766, 1767
and 1768—And 1.253,700<i>l.</i> of the 4 <i>per cent.</i> annuities,
subscribed into the 3 <i>per cent.</i> annuities in 1770.</p>

<p>All these loans were by 25 Geo. II. 1751, and several subsequent
Acts of Parliament, consolidated into one joint stock;
and carried, with the duties for paying the interest, to the
<i>Sinking Fund</i>. And in 1770, they formed a capital of
39.781,521<i>l.</i> which has been since reduced, by the payments
mentioned in the <i>Postscript</i> at the end of this tract, to the sum
specified in the account to which this note refers.—See a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_128" id="Page_2_128">[128]</a></span>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (7)—<span class="smcap">Reduced</span> 3 <i>per cent.</i> <span class="smcap">Bank Annuities</span>.
See <a href="#Page_2_121">page 121</a>.—The capital of these annuities consisted, in 1749,
of loans in 1746, 1747, and 1748, and navy, ordnance and
transport debts funded in 1749, amounting to 18.402,472<i>l.</i>
and all bearing 4 <i>per cent.</i> interest.—By the 23d of Geo. II.
1749, these loans were reduced to an interest of 3 <i>per cent.</i>
and by the great consolidating Act in 1751, they were converted
into one stock, and carried into the Sinking Fund with
the duties on carriages, and the additional duties on glass,
spirituous liquors, houses, windows, stamps, merchandize imported,
&amp;c. which had been granted for paying the interest.—In
1751, certain exchequer tallies and orders, amounting to
129,750<i>l.</i> were subscribed into this stock; and in 1765,
navy bills to the amount of 1,482,000<i>l.</i> were subscribed into
it, which made its whole original amount 20.014.222<i>l.</i>—In
1751, there was paid off 830,898<i>l.</i> being stock which had
not been subscribed agreeably to the Act in 1749 for reducing
interest; and in 1772, 1774, and 1775, so much more of
this stock was paid off as reduced it to its present amount.—See
Mr. Ashmore’s Analysis, p. 12-16.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (8)—<span class="smcap">Civil List million</span>. See <a href="#Page_2_121">page 121</a>.—The
income settled upon King George I. for his civil list,
was 700,000<i>l.</i>—In 1720, there had been granted him
besides, from the <i>Royal Exchange</i> and <i>London</i> Assurance companies,
300,000<i>l.</i> And in 1726, this million was farther
granted towards paying off his debts.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (9)—<span class="smcap">Bank Long Annuity</span>. See <a href="#Page_2_122">page 122</a>.—This
annuity consists of 128,250<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i> for 99 years,
given in 1761, as a <i>premium</i> to the subscribers of 11.400,000<i>l.</i>
at 3 <i>per cent</i>; and of 120,000<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i> for 98 years, given in
1762, as a premium to the lenders of twelve millions at 4 <i>per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_129" id="Page_2_129">[129]</a></span>
cent.</i> See <a href="#Page_2_95">page 95</a> and <a href="#Page_2_100">100</a>. It is charged, together with
the loans to which it was annexed, on the <i>Sinking Fund</i>.—Its
value in the Alley is about 25 years purchase;
but the remaining term is really worth 27 years purchase,
reckoning interest at 3½, (or the 3 <i>per cents.</i> being at 85¾.)
But when interest is at 4 <i>per cent.</i> or the 3 <i>per cents.</i> are at 75,
it is worth only 24 years purchase.—When this annuity is
called a <i>premium</i>, it must not be imagined, that no compensation
was given for it. Government received the value of it;
but, at the same time, made itself a debtor for that value.
And, what is very surprizing, this has been uniformly practised
with respect to all the premiums or douceurs granted by government;
and the consequence has been, that great and
needless increase of the public debt explained in the 3d section
of the 2d Part.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (10).—<span class="smcap">South-Sea Stock and Annuities</span>. See
<a href="#Page_2_122">page 122</a>.—These four capitals amounting to 25.984,684<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i>
consist almost entirely of the remainder of debts contracted in
the reigns of <i>King William</i> and Queen <i>Anne</i>. The following
account will probably give sufficient information concerning
them.</p>

<p>In 1711, Lord Oxford being minister, the proprietors of
certain navy, army, ordnance and transport debts, to the
amount of 9.177,968<i>l.</i> including arrears of interest, and half
a million for the current supplies, were incorporated into a
company for trading to the <i>South-seas</i>. They were allowed
6 <i>per cent.</i> interest for this debt, with 8000<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i> for
management; and the duties on wine, tobacco, <i>East-India</i>
goods, candles, &amp;c. were made perpetual, and granted as
a <i>Fund</i> (ever since called the <i>South-sea Company’s Fund</i>) for
paying the interest. This kept up public credit at the time,
and has been called the <i>Earl of Oxford</i>’s master-piece.—By
the 1st of Geo. I. 822,032<i>l.</i> consisting chiefly of interest
payable on the Company’s capital, was added to the capital,
in consequence of which it was increased to <span class="smcapuc">TEN MILLIONS</span>,
(ever since called their <i>original capital</i>) bearing 6 <i>per cent.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_130" id="Page_2_130">[130]</a></span>
interest.—In 1717, they agreed to take 5 <i>per cent</i>; and this
was the first great reduction of interest, which in conjunction
with the same reduction of the other redeemable debts almost
all carrying 6 <i>per cent.</i> laid the foundation of the <span class="smcap">Sinking
Fund</span> established in this year. But it is remarkable, that so
fast did interest fall at this time, that the price of <i>South-sea
stock</i>, notwithstanding this reduction, rose from 101 to 111.—In
1719, the <i>South-sea</i> capital was increased to 11.746,844<i>l.</i>
bearing 5 <i>per cent.</i> interest (with an addition of 1,397<i>l.</i> 9<i>s.</i>
to their former allowance for management) by advancing to
government 544,142<i>l.</i> and by the proprietors of 94,329<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i>
lottery annuities for 32 years granted in 1710, accepting in
lieu of them 1.202,702<i>l.</i> <i>South Sea stock</i>.—In 1720, the
agreement was made by government with the South Sea Company,
which produced the great <span class="smcap">South Sea bubble</span>.—There
existed at that time <i>long</i> annuities to the amount of
666,821<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> and <i>short</i> annuities, for 32 years from 1710, to
the amount of 127,260<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> The proprietors of these
annuities were allowed to subscribe them into the <i>South Sea</i>
trading stock; and the Company, for every 100<i>l.</i> of the <i>long</i>
annuity which should be subscribed, were to receive from government
an addition to their capital of 2000<i>l.</i> bearing 5 <i>per cent.</i>
interest till 1727, and afterwards 4 <i>per cent.</i> till redeemed:
and for every 100<i>l.</i> of the <i>short</i> annuities, they were to
receive an addition to their capital of 1400<i>l.</i> bearing the same
interest.—They were besides to take in the redeemable debts
to the amount of 16.546,482<i>l</i>. and to receive an addition to
their capital of 100<i>l.</i> for every 100<i>l.</i> subscribed.—By the
subscription of the <i>long</i> and <i>short</i> annuities which followed this
agreement, a capital due from government to the Company
was created, which was greater by 3.034,769<i>l.</i> than the original
sum advanced for the annuities subscribed. And as
much of these annuities and of the redeemable debts were
subscribed, as increased the <i>South Sea</i> trading capital to
37.802,203<i>l.</i>—In 1722, four millions of this capital was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_131" id="Page_2_131">[131]</a></span>
purchased by the <span class="smcap">Bank</span>, (See Note 3.) which reduced it to
33.802,203<i>l.</i>—By 9 Geo. I. 1723, this remaining capital
was divided into two equal parts, one of which alone (or
16.901,101<i>l.</i>) was ordered to be the trading capital of the
Company, and the other part was directed to be called <i>South
Sea Annuities</i>.—In 1733, the <i>South Sea</i> trading capital had
been reduced by payments at different times to 14.651,137<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i>
By an Act of Parliament in that year, this remaining stock
received a farther division; and only a fourth part, or
3.662,784<i>l.</i> was allowed to be the Company’s stock; and the
other three parts, or 10.988,353<i>l.</i> were directed to be called
<span class="smcap">New</span> South Sea Annuities, in order to distinguish them from
the former annuities, which have ever since gone under the
name of <span class="smcap">Old</span> South Sea annuities.—From 1733, to the
present time, <span class="smcap">South Sea Stock</span> has continued the same;
but the capital of the <span class="smcap">Old</span> South Sea annuities has been
reduced, by redemptions, to 11,907,470<i>l.</i> and of the <span class="smcap">New</span>
South Sea annuities, to 8.494,830<i>l.</i> And of the whole <i>South
Sea</i> debt, which in 1722 was 33.802,203<i>l.</i> there has, since that
year, been paid off in all 9.737,119<i>l.</i> This should have reduced
it to 24.065,081<i>l.</i> but it is in reality 25.984,685<i>l.</i> The
reason of this is, that the diminution just mentioned of the
<i>South Sea</i> debt was made in part with money borrowed in
1751, to pay off such proprietors of South Sea annuities as
had refused to consent to the reduction of interest proposed to
them in 1749. The sum borrowed for this purpose was
2.100,000<i>l.</i> bearing 3 <i>per cent.</i> with 1181<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> for management.
This debt is now reduced by redemptions to the sum
specified in the preceding account; or to 1.919,600<i>l.</i></p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (11).—<span class="smcap">East-India Stock</span>. See <a href="#Page_2_123">page 123</a>.—In
1698, a company of merchants, in consideration of
two millions lent to government at 8 <i>per cent.</i> were incorporated,
and entitled to the sole privilege of trading to the <i>East-Indies</i>.—These
two millions formed the first capital of the
present <i>East-India</i> Company.—In 1702, an old company of
traders to the <i>East-Indies</i> was united to this company; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_132" id="Page_2_132">[132]</a></span>
1708, these united companies lent to government 1.200,000<i>l.</i>
without additional interest, which made their capital 3.200,000<i>l.</i>
bearing 5 <i>per cent.</i>—In 1730, this interest was reduced to
4 <i>per cent.</i> and by the 23d Geo. II. 1749, to 3 <i>per cent.</i>—The
salt duties, and some additional stamp duties, were at first
charged with the annuity due on this capital; but at present
the duties constituting the aggregate fund are charged with
it.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (12).—<span class="smcap">East-India Annuity</span>. See <a href="#Page_2_123">page 123</a>.—The
capital of this annuity was advanced to government in
1744, at 3 <i>per cent.</i> and, in consideration of this loan, the exclusive
charter of the Company was continued to Lady-day 1783,
at which time it is to cease, provided three years notice has
been given, and the debt due from government discharged.</p>

<p>An observation here forces itself upon me, which I have
often had occasion to make.—Part of this loan was a compensation
from the <i>East-India</i> Company for prolonging the
term of its charter; and, therefore, ought not to have been
included in the loan. The Company would have lent
750,000<i>l.</i> on the interest common at the time, or 4 <i>per cent.</i>
and the remainder would have been advanced as a gratuity.—It
is a pity those who managed these contracts for the public,
did not attend to the absurdity and extravagance of making a
<i>debt</i> of purchase money, and <i>borrowing</i> in the very act of
<i>selling</i>.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (13).—<span class="smcap">Exchequer Long Annuities</span>. See
<a href="#Page_2_123">page 123</a>.—These are the <i>long</i> annuities which, in 1720,
remained unsubscribed to the South Sea Company. See
Note 10.—They consist first of annuities to the amount
of 54,900<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> purchased by the 4th, 5th, and 6th
of <i>William</i> and <i>Mary</i>, for 96 years, from January 1695,
with the addition of 1350<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i> for salaries to exchequer
officers. These annuities were originally 14 <i>per cent.</i> life-annuities.
By the 6th and 7th of <i>William</i> and <i>Mary</i>, in
order to raise more money, these annuitants, or any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_133" id="Page_2_133">[133]</a></span>
persons for them, were offered a reversionary interest in the
annuities after the failure of the lives, till the end of 96 years
from January 1695, on paying 4½ years purchase, (that is 63<i>l.</i>)
for every annuity of 14<i>l.</i>—The predecessors of the present
company of the <span class="smcap">Million Bank</span> (so called from the <span class="smcapuc">MILLION</span>
lottery 1694, in which they were some of the principal
adventurers) purchased 30,669<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> of these reversionary
annuities. The life annuitants being now reduced to a very
small number, almost the whole of this annuity is lapsed to
the <i>company</i>; and though they have divided for several years
5 <i>per cent.</i> on a capital of half a million, yet their growing
savings, from the falling in of lives, have been such, that,
when their annuity ceases in 1791, they will, I am informed,
have accumulated a fund considerably larger, than the
capital on which they have made their dividends. But to
return.</p>

<p>The original sum contributed for these annuities was
1.836,276<i>l.</i> They are even now worth more than this sum.
The public has already paid above <span class="smcapuc">TEN MILLIONS</span>; and
by the time they are all extinct, it will have paid above
<span class="smcapuc">THIRTEEN MILLIONS</span>, on their account. This is great
extravagance; but it is nothing to the extravagance constantly
practised of borrowing on perpetual annuities, without putting
them into a fixed course of redemption.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (14).—<span class="smcap">Tontine</span> by an act of 6 Geo. III. See <a href="#Page_2_124">page
124</a>.—The intention of this Act was to raise 300,000<i>l.</i> towards
paying off navy bills, by offering to subscribers for every
100<i>l.</i> advanced, an annuity of 3<i>l.</i> for their lives, with benefit
of survivorship. But the scheme did not succeed, and only
18000<i>l.</i> was subscribed.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (15).—<span class="smcap">Life Annuities</span>. See <a href="#Page_2_124">page 124</a>.—The
annuities on <i>two</i> lives in 1694, were sold at 12<i>l.</i>
<i>per ann.</i> during <i>two</i> lives, of any ages, and the annuities on
<i>three</i> lives, at 10<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i> during three lives, for every 100<i>l.</i>
advanced.—This was very extravagant; for, supposing the
annuitants in general, about the age of 20 or 30, it was the
same, in the case of <i>two</i> lives, with giving above 10 <i>per cent.</i>
for money, and in the case of <i>three</i> lives, 9 <i>per cent.</i>—It
is, likewise, extremely absurd in these cases to pay no
regard to difference of ages. A <i>single</i> life at the age of 60,
supposing money improved at 4 <i>per cent.</i> is intitled to 11 <i>per
cent.</i> but at the age of 10, scarcely to 6 <i>per cent.</i> <i>Two</i> lives
at 60, are entitled, on the same supposition, to 8½ <i>per cent.</i>
but at 10, not to 5 <i>per cent.</i>—The original amount of these
annuities was 22,700<i>l.</i> nearly. In 1762, that is, in 68 years,
they were reduced by deaths no lower than 9,215<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The other life-annuities mentioned in the preceding account
were <i>douceurs</i> granted for loans in 1745, 1746, and 1757. An
account of the annuities granted in the last of these years may
be seen in <a href="#Page_2_101">page 101</a>.</p>

<p>The life-annuities in 1745, amounted to 22,500<i>l.</i> and
were granted, together with the profits of a lottery, for a loan
of two millions at 4 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_135" id="Page_2_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The life-annuities in 1746, amounted to 45,000<i>l.</i> and
were granted, with the profits of another lottery, for a loan of
three millions, at the same interest.—The remarks made
in the 3d section of the last part, and particularly in the note,
<a href="#Page_2_101">p. 101</a>, are applicable to these two loans. The value of the
life-annuities, and the profits of the lotteries, were made
a part of the public debt. And, supposing the life-annuities
worth, one with another, only 14 years purchase, and the
profits of the two lotteries worth 300,000<i>l.</i> it will follow, that
the capital created by these loans, instead of being 5.000,000<i>l.</i>
should have been only 3.755,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>But there is another remark, which it is proper to mention
here. The life-annuities granted in 1757, amounting to
33,750<i>l.</i> were, in January 1775, that is in 18 years, reduced
by deaths to 28,732<i>l.</i> or but a little more than a seventh part.
But, supposing the annuitants all in the firmest stage of life, or
between the age of 10 and 30, they ought, according to some
of the best tables of observations, to have been reduced a
<i>quarter</i>. These life-annuities have, therefore, fallen in much
more slowly than could have been expected; and I have found
the same to be true of all the other life-annuities.—The
reason, undoubtedly, is, that the tables exhibit the rate of
mortality among all sorts and orders of men taken together;
whereas, the lives on which annuities are bought, are a selection
of the better sort of lives from the general mass, and
therefore must be of greater value.—Indeed I am not
acquainted with any table of observations which gives the
probabilities of the duration of life high enough to be a guide
in this case; except that which was formed by Mr. <i>De Parcieux</i>,
from the French <i>Tontines</i>.—A calculation, therefore, of the
values of lives, agreeably to this table, would be of considerable
use.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note</span> (16).—<span class="smcap">Unfunded Debt</span>. See <a href="#Page_2_124">page 124</a>.—I
have given the navy debt, as it was in January, 1775.—The
civil list debt in 1775, was probably more than the
sum at which I have reckoned it. Lord <span class="smcap">Stair</span>, in his account
of the national debt, income, and expenditure, reckons it at
800,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_136" id="Page_2_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Much the greatest part of the foregoing debts,
with the taxes for paying the interest, including
the duties composing the <i>Aggregate</i>, <i>South-Sea</i>,
and <i>General</i> Funds, have, by the 25th of <i>George</i>
the Second, 1751, and several subsequent acts of
Parliament, been thrown into one general account;
and the <i>surplus</i> of the whole, after deducting
the interest, 800,000l. <i>per ann.</i> to the
civil list, and a few other payments, forms the
<span class="smcap">Sinking Fund</span>.—The debts not brought to
this account are about seven millions and a half
in the <i>South-Sea</i> House; 11.186,800l. of the
<i>Bank</i> capital; the Civil List million; four millions
and a half borrowed at 3½ <i>per cent.</i> in 1758; the
capital of the East-India annuity; and the Exchequer
long and life annuities, except those granted
in 1758. But the <i>surplusses</i> of the duties which
pay the interest of these debts are either carried
<i>immediately</i> into the <i>Sinking Fund</i> account; or
brought <i>first</i> to the <i>Aggregate</i> Fund, and from
thence carried into that account.—On the
contrary. Deficiencies in these duties when they
happen, are made good out of the Sinking
Fund; and afterwards replaced from the supplies.</p>

<p>For example. Three old nine-penny excises on
beer, with an additional three-pence per barrel,
producing above half a million annually; also,
3,700l. <i>per</i> week out of the hereditary excise on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_137" id="Page_2_137">[137]</a></span>
beer, together with some duties on paper, coals,
&amp;c. and ⅓ additional subsidy of tonnage and
poundage, are appropriated to the payment of
the Banker’s Annuity; the Life Annuities granted
in 1693 and 1694; the Exchequer Long Annuities;
and annuities on various sums subscribed
to the South-Sea Company in 1720. The surplusses
make a part of the <i>Aggregate Fund</i>; and
after contributing to satisfy the charge on that
fund, are carried into the <i>Sinking Fund</i>.—Again.
Certain additional duties on soap, parchment,
coals, &amp;c. are appropriated to pay the
interest of 1.250,000l. and of 1.750,000l. parts
of the Bank capital.—The surplusses are carried
<i>directly</i> to the <i>Sinking Fund</i>.—In like manner.
The duties on houses and windows imposed
by an act of the 20th of <i>George</i> the Second,
1747,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> after deducting from them 91,485l.
<i>per ann.</i> to satisfy certain charges on old house-duties
in the <i>Aggregate Fund</i>; and, also, other
duties on houses and windows imposed by the
2d and 6th of <i>George</i> the Third, amounting in
all to about 205,000l. <i>per ann.</i> are carried into the
Sinking Fund, together with the capitals, the interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_138" id="Page_2_138">[138]</a></span>
of which has been charged upon them.
But the addition to these duties (with a tax on
pensions) granted in 1758, and charged with the
interest (at 3½ <i>per cent.</i>) of the loan in that year,
having not been carried into the <i>Sinking Fund</i>,
and proving deficient; the deficiency is constantly
made good out of this fund, and afterwards replaced
from the supplies.</p>

<p>From the account in the <span class="smcap">Postscript</span>, at the
end of this tract, it will appear, that 10.639,793l. of
the public debt was discharged between the years
1763 and 1775; and also that the <i>funded</i> debt was,
in 1775, 1.400,000l. greater than it was at the end
of the last war. From hence, and from the amount
of the public debt in 1775, as stated in <a href="#Page_2_124">page 124</a>,
it follows, that the funded debt at the end of the
war was 130.943,051l. and the whole debt
146.582,844l. and, consequently, that the war
left upon the nation an <i>unfunded debt</i> amounting
to<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> 15.639,793l. This unfunded debt consisted
of the following particulars—Of 3.500,000l.
borrowed after the peace in 1763, and applied
towards bearing such expences of the war as
could not immediately cease with its operations.—Of
near <i>eight millions</i> in navy, victualling,
ordnance, and transport debts.—Of 1.800,000l.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_146" id="Page_2_146">[146]</a></span>
<i>Exchequer bills</i>; and the remainder, of subsidies
to foreign princes, extraordinaries of the army,
and German demands.</p>

<p>We are now involved in another war, and the
public debts are increasing again fast. <i>Exchequer</i>
Bills have been increased from 1.250,000l. to
1.500,000l. A new capital of 2.150,000l. has
been added to the 3 <i>per cent.</i> Consolidated Annuities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_148" id="Page_2_148">[148]</a></span>
And a vote of credit was given in the
last session of Parliament for a million. The last
year, therefore, has added 3.400,000l. to our
debts, besides a vast sum not yet provided for,
consisting of navy, ordnance, victualling, transport
and army debts.—The present year (1777) must
make another great addition to them; and what
they will be at the end of these troubles, no one
can tell.—The union of a <i>foreign</i> war to the
present <i>civil</i> war might perhaps raise them to
<span class="smcap">Two Hundred Millions</span>; but, more probably,
it would sink them to—<span class="smcap">Nothing</span>.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Ministers have of late sought to remove
the public apprehensions by general
accounts of the weakness of powers, which, from
the circumstances of former wars as well as national
prejudices, have been felt by the people as
jealous rivals or formidable enemies.—I wish it
was possible for me to confirm these accounts; and
by contrasting the preceding state of our own
debts with a similar one of those of <span class="smcap">France</span>, to
shew, that from this power in particular we have
nothing to fear. The following particulars, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_149" id="Page_2_149">[149]</a></span>
the correctness of which I can rely, may give some
assistance in judging of this subject.</p>

livres) consisted of money procured by the sale of
taxes, by free-gifts, and extra-impositions during
the war, which left behind them no debts: And
26.550,000l. (597.380,100 livres) consisted of
LOANS, or money raised on perpetual annuities,
life-annuities, and lotteries.—At the beginning of
1769 the whole amount of the debts of <i>France</i>,
including all arrears and capitals advanced on annuities
and lotteries, was 128.622,000l. sterling,
or 2.894.053,616 livres. The annual charge derived
from this debt was 6.707,500l. sterling
(150.919,284 livres)—All the appropriations
amounted to 8.218,500l. sterling (184.919,284
livres).—The expences of the army, navy,
king’s houshold, prince’s houshold, foreign affairs,
&amp;c. amounted to 8.947,000l. or 201.307,312
livres. So that the whole annual expence was
17.165,000l. (386.226,596 livres).—The whole revenue
had amounted, before 1769, to 13.484,500l.
sterling (303.401,696 livres).—The public expence,
therefore, had exceeded the revenue
3.681,000l. (82.800,000 livres.) <i>per ann.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_150" id="Page_2_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>From the year 1769 to the present King’s Accession,
by forced reductions of interest, and by
new taxes, the public revenue was carried to
16.289,000l. sterling (366.508,000 livres) and
the public expence was reduced so as not to exceed
the revenue above 766,800l. <i>per annum</i>
(17.253,000 livres).—The anticipations also of
the revenue, which before 1769 had extended to
<i>seventeen</i> months, were reduced to <i>five</i> months.—Such
was the progress of reformation; namely,
an increase of revenue amounting to little less
than <span class="smcap">Three Millions</span> sterling <i>per ann.</i> in a few
years, under an unpopular minister, in the latter
days of a reign never characterized by an attention
to oeconomy, or a regard to the public interest;
and at this time particularly stamped by unprecedented
profusion and a general relaxation.</p>

<p>A new reign produced a new minister of
finance whose name will be respected by posterity
for a set of measures as new to the <i>political</i> world,
as any late discoveries in the system of nature
have been to the <i>philosophical</i> world.—Doubtful in
their operation, as all unproved measures must be,
but distinguished by their tendency to lay a solid
foundation for endless peace, industry, and a general
enjoyment of the gifts of nature, arts, and commerce.—The
edicts issued during his administration
exhibit indeed a phænomenon of the
most extraordinary kind. An absolute king rendering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_151" id="Page_2_151">[151]</a></span>
a voluntary account to his subjects, and
inciting his people to <i>think</i>; a right which it has
been the business of all absolute princes and their
ministers to extinguish in the minds of men.—In
these edicts the king declared in the most
distinct terms against a bankruptcy, an augmentation
of taxes, and new loans; while the minister
applied himself to increase every public resource
by principles more liberal than <i>France</i>, or any
part of <i>Europe</i>, ever had in serious contemplation.—It
is much to be regretted, that the opposition
he met with, and the intrigues of a
court, should have deprived the world of those
lights which must have resulted from the example
of such an administration.</p>

<p>After a short interval, a nomination, in some
respects still more extraordinary, has taken place in
the court of <span class="smcap">France</span>. A court which a few years
since was distinguished by its bigotry and intolerance,
has raised a <i>Protestant</i>, the subject of a
small but virtuous republic, to a decisive lead in
the regulation of its finances. It is to be presumed,
that so singular a preference will produce
an equally singular exertion of integrity and talents.
Though differing from Monsieur <span class="smcap">Turgot</span>
in several principles, which regard the larger
lines of government, he appears by his first steps,
and, particularly, the preamble to a late edict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_152" id="Page_2_152">[152]</a></span>
for raising 24 millions of livres by a lottery, to
put his foot on the same great basis of general
justice, and a strict conservation of the faith o£
the king; and points more particularly at the
surest of all resources in any modern states, a
simplification of taxes and a reformation in the
collection of them. This administration, making
improvements in the Revenue its immediate object,
is more capable of present exertion; and,
as such, is more formidable.</p>

<p>From these facts and observations it is impossible
not to conclude, that if we trust our safety
to the difficulties of <span class="smcap">France</span>, we may find ourselves
fatally deceived. I will add, that though
(like the 3s. land-tax and lotteries among ourselves)
some of the extraordinary impositions of
the last war have been continued in <i>France</i>, there
are some which ceased with the war, and which
they can renew. It is, particularly, an advantage
of unspeakable importance to them, that they can
carry on a war, as they did the last, at <i>half</i> our expence;
and that, having no dependence on the flattering
delusion of paper, they can, as they did in
1759, bear even a bankruptcy in the middle of a war,
and yet carry it on vigorously.—Their debts time
itself is sinking fast. Of 3.111,000l. (seventy millions
of livres) in annuities on the <i>Hotel de Ville</i> at
<i>Paris</i>, 1.777,000l. (forty millions of livres) consisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_153" id="Page_2_153">[153]</a></span>
in 1774 of Life Annuities, which were falling by
deaths at the rate of 71,000l. (1.600,000 livres)
every year.—Even their loss of credit, whatever
present embarrassment attends it, favours them
upon the whole. To this they owe the advantages
just mentioned. The facility with which our
high credit has enabled us to run in debt ensnares
us; and, if a change of measures does not take
place,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> must <i>ruin</i> us. Experience has given them
a just horror at borrowing on permanent funds;
and were they inclined to do it, they are not able
to do it to any great amount; and, consequently,
they cannot go on mortgaging one resource after
another till none is left.—While we lose sight
of the capital in the interest, they carry their
views chiefly to the reimbursement of the capital;
and after receiving high interest, for some years,
can be satisfied with receiving back a part of their
capital.—Their debts, being confined in a great
measure to the <i>Farmers General</i> and others at
<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, are not circulated and diffused among
the body of the people in the manner ours are:
And it is well known, that they can make use of
methods to discharge them which our government
must never think of. The acts of arbitrary power
and unjust expedients to which, on many occasions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_154" id="Page_2_154">[154]</a></span>
they have had recourse for this purpose
without producing any tumults, are such as appear
to us almost incredible; and should the time ever
come, when it will be necessary in this country to
make use of any violence of the same kind, all
government will probably be at an end.</p>

<p>In point of territory and number of inhabitants,
the two countries will bear no comparison<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.
We have hitherto opposed <i>France</i> by our free
spirit, and our colonies; and to them chiefly we
owe our prosperity and victories. Our colonies
once separated from us, the islands will soon follow.
But should they remain ours, our comparative
advantages will best appear from the following

always preserve her distinguished happiness, and
escape the danger which now threatens her. And
may the time soon come, when all mankind, sensible
of the value of the blessings of peace and
equal liberty, shall suffer one another to enjoy
them, and learn war no more.</p>

<p>The estimate for the peace establishment, including
miscellaneous expences, amounted, in
1775, to 3.703,476l.—But the extraordinary expences,
occasioned by the war with America,
made it fall very short.—In 1774 it amounted to
3.784,452l. exclusive of 250,000l. raised by Exchequer
Bills, towards defraying the expence of
calling in the gold coin. And the medium for eleven
years, from 1765, has been nearly 3.700,000l.—According
to the accounts which I have collected,
the expence of the peace establishment (including
miscellaneous expences) was in 1765,
1766, and 1767, 3.540,000l. <i>per ann.</i>—In 1768,
1769, and 1770, it was 3.354,000l. <i>per ann.</i>—In
1771, 1772, 1773, 1774, and 1775, the average
has been nearly four millions <i>per ann.</i> exclusive
of the expence of calling in the coin.</p>

<p class="tb">The parliament votes for the sea service 4l.
<i>per</i> month <i>per</i> man, including wages, wear and
tear, victuals and ordnance. This allowance is
insufficient, and falls short every year more or less,
in proportion to the number of men voted. From
hence, in a great measure, arises that annual increase
of the navy debt, mentioned in the second
article of the <i>National Expenditure</i>. This increase
in 1772 and 1773 was 669,996l. or 335,000l. <i>per
ann.</i> The number of men voted in those two
years, was 20,000. I have supposed them reduced
to 16,000, and the annual increase of the Navy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_162" id="Page_2_162">[162]</a></span>
Debt to be only 250,000l.—Add 100,000l.
for the annual increase of the Civil List Debt,
and the total will be 350,000l.</p>

<p class="tb">Soon after the publication of the preceding account
in <i>February</i> last year, the <span class="smcap">Earl of Stair</span>
obliged the public with another account of the
same kind, which brings out a conclusion much
more unfavourable. According to this account,
were lotteries abolished, and the land-tax at 3s. in
the pound only, there would be a <i>deficiency</i> in the
revenue, instead of such a <i>surplus</i> as I have stated.
The following remarks will shew the reason of
this difference.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Earl of Stair</span> has taken the annual
produce of the <i>Sinking</i> Fund at 2.506,400l. being
the average produce of <span class="smcapuc">EIGHT</span> years ended at
<i>Lady day</i> 1775.—I have taken it at 2.610,759l.
being the average of <span class="smcapuc">FIVE</span> years ended at <i>Christmas</i>
1775.—The neat produce of the land and malt
taxes has been also taken near 50,000l. higher in
my account; and I have besides admitted 50,000l.
<i>per ann.</i> for casual supplies, which his Lordship
has not charged.</p>

<p>The annual increase of the Navy Debt, <span class="smcap">Lord
Stair</span> states at 300,000l. and of the Civil List at
200,000l. I have stated the former at 250,000l.
and the latter at 100,000l.—In order also to
avoid, as much as possible, all exaggeration, I
have thrown out the expence of the new coinage.
Lord Stair has admitted it, and given an yearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_163" id="Page_2_163">[163]</a></span>
expence derived from hence of 100,000l.—He
has also taken the Peace Establishment for
1774, as a fair medium for common years of
peace, because it was lower in that year than in
the three years preceding 1775. I have taken
the average of <i>eleven</i> years of peace, which is
75,000l. less.</p>

<p>In consequence of these differences, the national
<span class="smcapuc">PEACE</span> expenditure in <i>Lord Stair</i>’s account comes
out 325,000l. <i>per ann. higher</i> than in mine; and
the national income comes out 204,359l. <i>lower</i>;
from whence it follows, that without lotteries,
and the land being at 3s. in the pound, the kingdom
must, according to his Lordship’s calculation,
run out at the rate of about 200,000l. every year.</p>

<p>In some of the particulars I have mentioned,
this account is probably nearest to the truth; but,
I hope, it will be considered, that I have studied
to give moderate accounts, and aimed at erring
always rather on the favourable than the unfavourable
side.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Second Method of deducing the <span class="smcap">Surplus</span> of
the <span class="smcap">Revenue</span>.</i></p>

<p>From the year 1763 to the year 1775, or during
a period of 12 years, 10.639,793l. of the public<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
debt was paid off.—The money employed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_164" id="Page_2_164">[164]</a></span>
this purpose must have been derived from the
surplus of the <i>ordinary</i> revenue, added to the
<i>extraordinary</i> receipts. These receipts have consisted
of the following articles.—1st. The land-tax
at 4s. in the pound in 1764, 1765, 1766, and
1771; or 1s. in the pound extraordinary for four
years, making 1.750,000l.—2. The profits of
ten lotteries<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> making (at 150,000l. each lottery)
1.500,000l.—3. A contribution of 400,000l.
<i>per ann.</i> for five years from the <span class="smcap">East India</span> Company,
making 2.000,000l.—4. Savings by debts
discharged at a discount,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> making at least
400,000l.—5. Paid by the Bank in 1764 for
the renewal of their charter, 110,000l.—6. Savings
on high grants during the war; produce of <i>French</i>
prizes taken before the declaration of war; sale
of lands in the ceded islands; and composition
for maintaining <i>French</i> prisoners,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_165" id="Page_2_165">[165]</a></span>
2.520,000l.—All these sums amount to
8.280,000l. There remains to make up 10.639,793l.
(the whole debt discharged) 2.359,793l. and this,
therefore, is the amount of the whole surplus of
the <i>ordinary</i> revenue for twelve years; or 196,000l.
<i>per ann.</i><a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>The Earl of <span class="smcap">Stair</span> has also, in this method,
calculated the <i>surplus</i> of the Revenue; and makes
the total, for eleven years, to be no more than
2.557,378l. even with the assistance of lotteries,
and the land-tax at 4s. in the pound for five
years; from whence it follows, that <i>without</i> these
assistances, there would have been a deficiency of
near 60,000l. <i>per ann.</i>—The reason is, that his
Lordship has taken the whole debt paid since 1763,
at no more than 7.053,855l. or three millions and
a half less than I have made it; and he has
taken it so much less, chiefly in consequence of
including in the amount of the public debt in
1775, the excess of the expences of that year
above the common peace expences. This excess
is to be charged to the present war; and, in determining
the ordinary peace <i>surplus</i>, which is my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_166" id="Page_2_166">[166]</a></span>
object, it was proper to exclude it, and to terminate
the account at the commencement of the war.—I
will only add, that Lord <span class="smcap">Stair</span> has also included
more in the extraordinary receipts than I have;
and, particularly, 700,000l. which he supposes
the public gained by the <span class="smcapuc">TEA INDEMNITY</span>.—But
this was only a compensation made by the
<i>East-India</i> Company for the loss which the public
sustained by taking off, in 1766, a part (or 1s. <i>per</i>
pound) of the duty on tea. In 1772 it was restored;
and the excise upon tea has since, if I am
rightly informed, produced as much as ever.
<i>Before</i> 1766, it produced annually 474,091l. Immediately<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
after 1766, it produced 341,284l.—But
in 1775, it produced near half a million.</p>

<p>It must be seen, that this account is imperfect

that the whole money raised <span class="smcapuc">DIRECTLY</span> by the
taxes, (exclusive of tithes, county rates, and the
taxes which support the poor,) cannot be much
less than <span class="smcap">Twelve Millions</span>. The <i>Earl of Stair</i>

more, by including in his estimate several articles
which I have omitted; particularly, the interest
and management on the equivalent to <i>Scotland</i>,
the Scotch crown Revenues, Dutchy of <i>Cornwall</i>
and <i>Lancaster</i> Fines, &amp;c. He has also given an
estimate of the fees and perquisites of office of
every kind, and reckoned them at half a million;
whereas, I have only reckoned the perquisites of
office at the <i>Custom-house</i>.</p>

<p>I should be inexcusable were I to quit this subject,
without taking notice of the particular gratitude
due from the public to <i>Lord Stair</i>, for publishing his
papers; and for stepping forth at this time to draw
attention, by the weight of his name and character,
to calculations, which, as he justly says, “it becomes
every man of property among us to
understand; to awaken the nation from the
lethargy into which the mockery of paper
wealth has plunged it; and to bear his testimony
against the present unnatural war.”</p>

<p>From 15.483,553<i>l.</i> the total of debts discharged,
subtract 7.150,000<i>l.</i> the total of debts contracted;
and the remainder, or 8.333,553<i>l.</i> will be the diminution
of the public debts since 1763. Also,
from 561,342<i>l.</i> the total of the decrease of the
annual interest, subtract 199,500<i>l.</i> (the total of
its increase), and the remainder, or 361,842<i>l.</i> will
be the interest or annuity saved since 1763.—To
this must be added 12,537<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i> saved by
changing a capital of 1.253,700<i>l.</i> (part of
20.240,000<i>l.</i>) from an interest of 4 to 3 <i>per cent.</i>
pursuant to an act of the 10th of George III.;
also the life-annuities that have fallen in; and
7,500<i>l.</i> <i>per ann.</i> gained by the falling (in 1771)
of 1.500,000<i>l.</i> from an interest of 3½ to 3 <i>per cent.</i>;
which will make a saving in the whole of near
400,000<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>: And it is to this saving,
together with the increase of luxury, that the increase
of the <i>Sinking-Fund</i> for the last ten years has
been owing.</p>

<p>To the debts discharged the following additions
must be made.</p>

<p>In 1764 there was paid towards discharging the
extraordinary expences of the army, 987,434<i>l.</i>:
In 1765, these expences amounted to 404,496<i>l.</i>:
In 1766, to 479,088<i>l.</i>—Total 1.871,018<i>l.</i>—This
sum is at least a million higher than the extraordinary
expences of the army for three years in
a time of peace. This excess, being derived from
the preceding war, must be reckoned a debt left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_174" id="Page_2_174">[174]</a></span>
by the war. And the same is true of 1.106,000<i>l.</i>
applied, in 1764, 1765, and 1766, towards satisfying
<i>German</i> demands.—There are likewise
some smaller sums of the same kind; such as subsidies
to <i>Hesse-Cassel</i>, <i>Brunswick</i>, &amp;c. And they
may be taken at 200,000<i>l.</i>—The total of all
these sums is 2.306,240<i>l.</i>; which, added to
8.333,553<i>l.</i> makes the whole diminution of the
public debt since 1763, to be 10.639,793<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Soon after the peace in 1763, an unfunded debt,

(as appears from <a href="#Page_2_171">page 171</a>) 11.983,553<i>l.</i>;

years, from 1767 to 1774, 1.415,883<i>l.</i> navy-debt
was paid off. See <a href="#Page_2_172">page 172</a>. But, as this is a
debt arising from constant deficiencies in the peace
estimates for the navy, it is a part of the current
peace expences.—In 1768 this debt was<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
1.226,915<i>l.</i>—In 1774 it was 1.850,000<i>l.</i>; and
consequently, though 1.415,883<i>l.</i> was paid off, an
addition was made to it, in seven years, of
623,085<i>l.</i> It increased, therefore, at the rate of

<p id="RESOLUTION">The paper from which I have taken the following
account, came into my hands after
almost the whole of this work had been printed
off. It contains a fact of so much importance,
that I cannot satisfy myself without laying it
before the public.—In a Committee of
<span class="smcap">Congress</span> in <i>June</i> 1775, a declaration was drawn
up containing an offer to <span class="smcap">Great Britain</span>, “that
the Colonies would not only continue to grant
extraordinary aids in time of war, but also, if
allowed a free commerce, pay into the <span class="smcap">Sinking
Fund</span> such a sum annually for <span class="smcapuc">ONE HUNDRED
YEARS</span>, as should be <i>more</i> than sufficient
in that time, if faithfully applied, to extinguish
all the present debts of <span class="smcap">Britain</span>. Or, provided
this was not accepted, that, to remove the
groundless jealousy of <i>Britain</i> that the Colonies
aimed at Independence and an abolition of the
Navigation Act, which, in truth, they had never
intended; and also, to avoid all future disputes
about the right of making that and other Acts
for regulating their commerce for the general
benefit, they would enter into a covenant with
<i>Britain</i>, that she should fully possess and exercise
that right for <i>one hundred years</i> to come.”</p>

<p>At the end of the <i>Observations on Civil Liberty</i>,
I had the honor of laying before the public the
Earl of <i>Shelburne’s</i> plan of Pacification with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_176" id="Page_2_176">[176]</a></span>
Colonies. In that plan, it is particularly proposed,
that the Colonies should grant an annual
supply to be carried to the Sinking Fund, and
unalienably appropriated to the discharge of the
public debt.—It must give this excellent Peer
great pleasure to learn, from this resolution, that
even this part of his plan, as well as all the other
parts, would, most probably, have been accepted
by the Colonies. For though the resolution only
offers the alternative of either a <i>free</i> trade, with
extraordinary aids and an annual supply, or an
<i>exclusive</i> trade confirmed and extended; yet there
can be little reason to doubt, but that to avoid
the calamities of the present contest, both would
have been consented to; particularly, if, on our
part, such a revisal of the laws of trade had been
offered as was proposed in Lord Shelburne’s plan.</p>

<p>The preceding resolution was, I have said,
drawn up in a Committee of the Congress. But
it was not entered in their minutes; a severe Act
of Parliament happening to arrive at that time,
which determined them not to give the sum proposed
in it.</p>

<p>In 1764, there was paid off 650,000l. navy-debt;
but this I have not charged, because scarcely
equal to that annual increase of the navy-debt for
1764, 1765, and 1766, which forms a part of
the ordinary peace establishment. The same is
true of 300,000l. navy-debt, paid in 1767; of
400,000l. paid in 1769; of 100,200l. paid in

<p>From 15.483,553l. the total of debts discharged,
subtract 7.150,000l. the total of debts contracted;
and the remainder, or 8.333,553l. will be the diminution
of the public debts since 1763. Also,
from 568,842l. the total of the decrease of the
annual interest, subtract 199,500l. (the total of
its increase), and the remainder, or 369,342l.
will be the interest or annuity saved since 1763.—To
this must be added 12,537l <i>per ann.</i> saved by
changing a capital of 1.253,700l. (part of
20.240,000l.) from an interest of 4 to 3 <i>per cent.</i>
pursuant to an act of the 10th of George III.; also
the life-annuities that have fallen in; which will
make a saving in the whole of near 400,000l. <i>per
annum</i>: And it is to this saving, together with
the increase of luxury, that the increase of the
<i>Sinking Fund</i> for the last ten years has been owing.</p>

<p>To the debts discharged the following additions
must be made.</p>

<p>In 1764 there was paid towards discharging the
extraordinary expences of the army, 987,434l.
In 1765, these expences amounted to 404,496l.
In 1766, to 479,088l.—Total 1.871,018l.—This
sum is 1.100,000l. higher than the extraordinary
expences of the army for three years in a
time of peace. This excess, being derived from
the preceding war, must be reckoned a debt left
by the war. And the same is true of 1.106,000l.
applied, in 1764, 1765, and 1766, towards satisfying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_180" id="Page_2_180">[180]</a></span>
<i>German</i> demands.—There are likewise
some smaller sums of the same kind; such as subsidies
to <i>Hesse-Cassel</i>, <i>Brunswick</i>, &amp;c. And they
may be taken at 200,000l.—The total of all
these sums is 2.406,240l. which, added to
8.333,553l. makes the whole diminution of the
public debts, or the whole saving of the kingdom,
since 1763, to be 10.739,793l.</p>

<p>Soon after the peace in 1763, an unfunded debt,
amounting to 6.983,553l. was funded on the
<i>Sinking Fund</i>, and on new duties on wine and cyder,
at 4 <i>per cent.</i> There has been since borrowed
and funded on coals exported, window-lights, &amp;c.
6.400,000l. The funded debt, therefore, has increased
since the war 13.383,553l. It has decreased
(as may appear from <a href="#Page_2_177">page 177</a>) 11.983,553l.
and, consequently, there has been on the whole an
addition to it of 1.400,000l.—During seven
years, from 1768 to 1774, 1.115,883l. navy-debt
was paid off. See <a href="#Page_2_178">page 178</a>. But, as this is a
debt arising from constant deficiencies in the peace
estimates for the navy, it is a part of the current
peace expences.—On the 31st of December,
1767, this debt was 1.213,072l.—On the 31st of
December, 1774, it was 1.850,000l. and consequently,
though 1.115,883l. was paid off, an
addition was made to it, in seven years, of
673,028l. It increased, therefore, at the rate of
255,558l. <i>per ann.</i></p>

<h2>SUPPLEMENT
TO
SECTION III PART II.</h2>

<p><i>Containing additional Observations on Schemes
for raising Money by Public Loans.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">It is impossible, that any attentive person can
reflect without concern, on that monstrous accumulation
of artificial debt for which no value
has been received, which has been pointed out in
different parts of the preceding Tract; and, particularly
in the third Section of the second Part.
This being a subject which, in the present state of
our finances, is highly interesting; I have been induced
to return to it in this place; and to offer
some further observations and proposals which have
occurred to me in reconsidering it, and which I
think necessary to explain and confirm those which
have been already offered.</p>

<p class="tb">There are two methods in which money is capable
of being borrowed for public services. The
first is, by offering such <i>high</i> interest as may of
itself be sufficient to induce lenders to advance the
sums that are wanted: And the second is, by offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_182" id="Page_2_182">[182]</a></span>
a <i>low</i> interest, with a <i>gratuity</i> or <i>douceur</i> to
produce the acceptance of it.—The last has been
the method in which our government has most
commonly borrowed money; and the gratuity offered
has been either a right to a greater capital
than the sum advanced, or a <i>long</i> or <i>short</i> or <i>life</i>
annuity, or the profits of a lottery, or some advantages
of trade.—The first without doubt, is the
most rational method of borrowing; and the latter
is so absurd and extravagant as to be incapable of
being adopted in the common transactions of life.—In
order to give a just and full idea of this, I
shall instance in the last loan; specifying the
manner in which it <i>would</i> have been made if the
usual method of borrowing had been followed;
and comparing this with the manner in which it
<i>was</i> made; and the manner in which, I think, it
<i>might</i> have been made to the greatest advantage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Five millions</span>, it is well known, were borrowed
last year; and, had the old plan of borrowing been
adopted, this sum would have been borrowed by
some such scheme as one of the <i>two</i> following.</p>

<p>First. Interest in the public funds being then
near 4 <i>per cent. per ann.</i> an interest of only 3 <i>per
cent.</i> would have been offered; or, in other words,
for every 100l. in <i>money</i>, 100l. <i>stock</i> carrying 3 <i>per
cent.</i> (worth then 78l.) would have been given;
but at the same time, as a <i>premium</i> or <i>compensation</i>
for accepting such low interest, a life-annuity, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_183" id="Page_2_183">[183]</a></span>
a short annuity would have been offered worth
somewhat more than the difference between
100l. and 78l. or about 24l. The whole premium,
therefore, in raising <i>five millions</i>, would
have been equal in value to about 1.200,000l.
and, supposing it to have been either a life-annuity,
or a short annuity for 17 years of 2l. worth 12
years purchase, annexed to every 100l. stock, the
whole annual charge incurred by the loan would
have been 250,000l. for a term of years, and
150,000l. for ever till the capital is redeemed.</p>

<p>It is manifest that the capital including in it according
to this account almost the whole <i>premium</i>,
the public makes itself, by this mode of borrowing,
a <i>debtor</i> for the very thing it <i>gives</i>; and,
besides paying the annuity, obliges itself to advance
at redemption the whole value of it.—It is proper
to add, that this is done <i>unnecessarily</i>, because
1.200,000 might have been procured by selling
the annuity, and the remaining 3.800,000l. necessary
to make up five millions, might have been
procured, as will be shewn presently, without
any <i>douceur</i> by giving higher interest.</p>

<p>But there is another method of borrowing
which has been practised by government on former
occasions, and which might have been adopted in
the last loan.</p>

<p>For every 100l. advanced a new capital in the
3 <i>per cent.</i> funds worth that sum would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_184" id="Page_2_184">[184]</a></span>
sold, including a funded 10l. lottery ticket. This
new capital would have been nearly 127l. three
<i>per cent. stock</i> for every 100l. in <i>money</i>, or
6.343,954l. stock for <span class="smcapuc">FIVE MILLIONS</span> in money;
of which stock 5.718,954l. would have been sold,
to encourage subscriptions, at 2 <i>per cent.</i> below the
market price, that is, at 76l. ½; and the remaining
stock, having a lottery annexed, would have
been sold at <i>par</i>. A fictitious or artificial capital,
therefore, would have been created, or a debt incurred
more than the value received, of 1.343,954l.
besides relinquishing about 150,000l. which might
have been obtained by the profits of the lottery.</p>

<p>I have been seldom more surprized than at the
preference of this scheme, which, at the time of
settling the last loan, was expressed by some very
respectable members of the House of Commons;
nor can this preference be easily accounted for on
any other supposition than that they consider the
public debts as incumbrances, never to be removed,
and, therefore, think it of no consequence
with what difficulties the redemption of
them is loaded by an increase of capitals bearing
low interest. It must be acknowledged indeed that
this method of borrowing would have been attended
with a small present advantage; for the
interest of 6.343,954l. at 3 <i>per cent.</i> is 190,318l.
and this, together with the interest of 150,000l.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_185" id="Page_2_185">[185]</a></span>
or 6000l. <i>per ann.</i> lost by giving up the profits
of a lottery, would have been the whole present
annual charge it would have brought on the
public. But if this be a sufficient reason for preferring
such a scheme, it would perhaps be best to
create capitals bearing 2 <i>per cent.</i> or even 1 <i>per cent.</i>
interest; for probably such capitals would bear a
better price, in proportion to the rates of interest,
than any 3 <i>per cent.</i> capitals, and consequently, a
greater present saving might be made by selling
them. No other objection can be made to this
than that by lowering interest, and laying the
public under an obligation to return <i>double</i> or <i>triple</i>
every sum it receives; the redemption of the public
debts might be rendered so expensive and difficult
as to be entirely impracticable. But this would
be of no consequence if indeed their redemption is
already become impracticable; and if, therefore,
every new charge they bring on the public is to
be considered as laid on for eternity.</p>

<p class="tb">With these schemes let us now compare the
scheme actually adopted for the last loan.</p>

<p>Instead of a 3 <i>per cent.</i> capital, a new capital
bearing 4 <i>per cent.</i> interest, irredeemable for ten
years, was offered at 95l. for every 100l. <i>stock</i>,
with two <i>douceurs</i> to raise the value of the stock
above 100l. in money; namely, a short annuity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_186" id="Page_2_186">[186]</a></span>
of a <span class="smcapuc">HALF</span> <i>per cent.</i> for ten years, (reckoned
worth 4l. 2s.) and the profit (reckoned at 3l.) of
one ticket in a money lottery consisting of 50,000
tickets.</p>

<p>The chief difference between this scheme and
the first I have described is, that the new stock
created is a <span class="smcapuc">FOUR</span> <i>per cent.</i> instead of a <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span> <i>per
cent.</i> stock. But this is a difference of particular
importance, and brings it near to such plans of
borrowing as appear to me the best.—In the
<i>first</i> scheme, the artificial capital is 1.200,000l. In
the <i>second</i>, 1.343,954l. In this <i>third</i> scheme it is
only 250,000l. This scheme, therefore, has evidently
great merit; and perhaps, in the present
state of the public debts, it does not admit of any
great improvement. There is, however, an easy
alteration which, I think, would have been an
improvement, and which I shall take the liberty
to mention.</p>

<p>According to a preceding observation, the two
<i>douceurs</i> being included in the capital, are granted,
and must be paid twice over. This is so absurd
and extravagant that it ought to be avoided as
far as possible; and it might have been avoided,
in a great measure, by offering for every 100l.
advanced 95l. stock, carrying 4 <i>and a quarter</i>
interest irredeemable for ten years, with the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_187" id="Page_2_187">[187]</a></span>
short annuity and a lottery ticket annexed.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> In
this case, the new capital would have been
4.750,000<i>l</i>. carrying (at 4¼ <i>per cent.</i>) 201,875<i>l</i>.
<i>per ann.</i> interest. There would, therefore, have
been a saving of 250,000l. in the capital; and the
annual charge would have been nearly the same.</p>

<p>It must be observed that this scheme supposes
that a stock bearing 4¼ <i>per cent.</i> interest would
have been valued nearly at <i>par</i>; and, according
to the principles on which the scheme was calculated,
it could not have been valued at much less;
or, supposing it valued at 1 or 2 <i>per cent.</i> less, the
difference might have been made up by only adding
two or three years to the duration of the short
annuity and the term of irredeemableness.—Had
a <i>stock</i> been offered bearing 4¼ <i>per cent.</i> interest irredeemable
for ten years, one <i>half</i> at least of the
short annuity might have been saved. The annual
charge for ten years would have been somewhat
less;<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and the excess afterwards would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_188" id="Page_2_188">[188]</a></span>
been much more than compensated by the advantages
at redemption attending a higher interest
and a smaller capital.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, such a scheme as the following
would have been preferable to any of those now
proposed.</p>

<p>For every 100l. in <i>money</i> 75l. stock irredeemable
for 10 years and carrying 4¼ <i>per cent.</i> interest,
might have been offered, together with an annuity
for 27 years of 1½ <i>per cent.</i> (valued cheap at 16
years purchase, or 24l.) and the advantage of a
lottery ticket. This scheme would have been as
likely to be attended with a profit as that which
was adopted. The new capital would have been
only 3.750,000l. bearing 159,375l. interest. The
short annuity would have been 75,000l. and the
whole annual charge (supposing no redemptions
of the capital to take place after ten years)
234,375l. for 27 years, and afterwards 159,375l.
It appears, therefore, that 1.250,000l. or a <i>quarter</i>
of the capital that was actually created, would have
been saved; and also a rent charge on the public
after 27 years of 40,750l. <i>per ann.</i> for ever.—The
additional expence to balance these advantages
would have been 9.650l. <i>per ann.</i> for ten years,
and 34,375l. <i>per ann.</i> for 17 years. In other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_189" id="Page_2_189">[189]</a></span>
words; the public would have absolutely secured
the redemption of a <i>quarter</i> of the loan, (or
of 1.250,000l.) besides an easier redemption of the
remainder, at the expence of 680,875l. in the
whole,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> to be paid annually in small sums during
the course of 27 years.</p>

<p class="tb">All that has been now said has gone on the supposition
that, agreeably to the calculations on
which the last loan was formed, 100l. <i>stock</i> irredeemable
for ten years and bearing 4 <i>per cent.</i> interest,
would sell at 17l. more than 100l. stock
bearing 3 <i>per cent.</i> interest; (or at 95l. when the
latter stock is at 78l.) and also, that a short annuity
for ten years would sell at 8⅟₁₀ years purchase.—But
events have shewn that these valuations were
too high. The new subscription (including 100l.
four <i>per cent.</i> stock, a half <i>per cent.</i> short annuity,
and the profit of a lottery ticket) should have sold,
according to these valuations, at about 102½. But
it never bore so high a price; and in a little time
it fell to <i>par</i>, and at last to 3 <i>per cent.</i> discount.—Various
reasons have been assigned for this; but
the true reasons were the following.</p>

<p>First. A general fall of near 2 <i>per cent.</i> which
took place in the stocks soon after the loan was
settled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_190" id="Page_2_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly. A lower valuation of the new 4 <i>per
cent.</i> stock and the short annuity which took place
in the <span class="smcap">Alley</span>.—This was the principal reason;
and it will be proper particularly to explain it. In
doing this, it will be necessary to look back a little
to the history of the public funds.</p>

<p class="tb">In 1717 the public debts were reduced from an
interest of 6 <i>per cent.</i> to 5 <i>per cent.</i> and in 1727,
from 5 <i>per cent.</i> to 4 <i>per cent.</i> In 1737 a bill was
brought into the <span class="smcap">House of Commons</span> by Sir <i>John
Barnard</i>, for a farther reduction from 4 to 3 <i>per
cent.</i> At this time the 3 <i>per cents.</i> were above <i>par</i>;
and even, during the three first years of the war
which began in 1740, they continued so high
that government was able to raise the necessary
supplies by borrowing at 3 <i>per cent.</i>—In such
circumstances, it was impossible the public creditors
should avoid expecting a <i>third</i> reduction; and
this expectation would necessarily link the value
of the <span class="smcapuc">FOUR PER CENTS</span>. by leading the public to
consider them as no more than a <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span> <i>per cent.</i>
stock having a short annuity of <span class="smcapuc">ONE</span> <i>per cent.</i> annexed.
Accordingly; <i>before</i> the war the difference
of price between the <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span> and the <span class="smcapuc">FOUR</span>
<i>per cent.</i> stocks was about 10 or 11 <i>per cent.</i>
After the commencement of the war, a reduction
becoming more doubtful and more distant, this
difference became greater, and generally kept between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_191" id="Page_2_191">[191]</a></span>
14 and 17 <i>per cent.</i> At the approach of
the <span class="smcap">Peace</span> in 1748, it sunk to 11 <i>per cent.</i> and soon
<i>after</i> the <span class="smcap">Peace</span>, the 3 <i>per cents.</i> having risen considerably
above <i>par</i>,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and an universal expectation
of a speedy reduction taking place, it sunk to
6 <i>per cent.</i>—It is evident, therefore, that the
price of the <span class="smcapuc">FOUR</span> <i>per cents.</i> has been governed by
the expectation of their reduction,<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and that,
had there been no such expectation, their price,
compared with the 3 <i>per cents.</i> would have been
much higher. It will appear presently to be most
probable, that had it not been for this expectation,
the prices of these stocks would not have differed
much from the proportion of the rates of interest.</p>

<p>In taking this account, I have only compared
the <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span> <i>per cents.</i> with the <span class="smcap">South-Sea FOUR</span> <i>per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_192" id="Page_2_192">[192]</a></span>
cent.</i> capitals before their reduction in 1749, at
which time they amounted to above 27 millions,
and were (as the consolidated three <i>per cent.</i> annuities
are now) the grand staple stock of the kingdom.
In 1746 and 1747, two new <span class="smcapuc">FOUR</span> <i>per cent.</i>
capitals were created redeemable at any time, and
transferable at the <span class="smcap">Bank</span>. The price of these
new capitals kept for some time after their creation,
considerably below the price of the old
<span class="smcap">South-Sea</span> four <i>per cents.</i> the reasons of which
were, I suppose, the general reasons which make
new funds bear a lower price than old ones; and,
particularly, their having less traffic in them, and
being small and detached parcels likely to be first
selected for the operations of finance.</p>

<p class="tb">Were the cause now assigned, or the expectation
of a reduction of interest, the only cause that governed
the comparative prices of 3 <i>per cent.</i> and 4
<i>per cent.</i> capitals, the excess of one above the other
would never be more than the supposed value of a
short annuity of 1l. till <i>reduction</i>.—But there
is another cause which may operate in this instance,
and which ought not to be overlooked; I mean,
the expectation of a greater payment at <i>redemption</i>.
The effect of the former is to <i>diminish</i>, and
of the latter to <i>increase</i> the value of <span class="smcapuc">FOUR</span> <i>per cent.</i>
capitals.—In order to understand this it must be
remembered, that when the 3 <i>per cents.</i> are at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_193" id="Page_2_193">[193]</a></span>
considerable discount, it becomes practicable to
redeem them under <i>par</i>, while debts bearing 4 <i>per
cent.</i> interest must be redeemed at <i>par</i>. This will
make a difference in favour of the latter, which
will be greater or less in proportion to the greater
or less discount at which the <i>three per cents.</i> are
sold, the greater or less quantity of stock bearing
4 <i>per cent.</i> interest, and the greater or less probability
that the whole or a considerable part of it will
be soon redeemed<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>—Let us suppose, for instance,
that all the public debts bearing 4 <i>per cent.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_194" id="Page_2_194">[194]</a></span>
interest, consist of a single capital of <span class="smcapuc">FIVE MILLIONS</span>
redeemable at any time; and that all the
rest of the public debts are <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span> <i>per cent.</i> capitals
sold at a discount of 12 <i>per cent.</i> or at 88l. for
every 100l. stock. In these circumstances, there
would be a certainty that the small stock bearing
4 <i>per cent.</i> interest would be selected for redemption
as soon as possible; and, as a stock carrying
such high interest could not be expected, when the
3 <i>per cents.</i> are at 88, to be redeemed under <i>par</i>,
its real value would on this account exceed that of
the <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span> <i>per cents.</i> more or less in proportion as
its redemption was more or less distant. And its
<i>whole</i> excess of value in these circumstances is to be
computed in the following manner.—It would consist
of a 3 <i>per cent.</i> capital, for every 100l. of
which 100l. in money is to be received; and of
an additional annuity of 1 <i>per cent.</i> till redemption.
Its excess of value, therefore, if the whole capital
was to be redeemed immediately, would be the
same with the discount of the 3 <i>per cents.</i> or 12
<i>per cent.</i> If the capital was not to be redeemed
till the end of 7 years, its excess of value would
consist of 12 <i>per cent.</i> payable seven years hence,
and the present worth of an annuity of 1 <i>per cent.</i>
for the intermediate term of seven years. 12l.
payable at the end of 7 years is worth in present
money (allowing compound interest at 4 <i>per cent.</i>)
9l. 2s. 6d. An annuity of 1l. for seven years is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_195" id="Page_2_195">[195]</a></span>
worth (reckoning the same interest) 6l. The
whole excess of value, therefore, will be 15l. 2s. 6d.
for every 100l. stock. If the redemption of the capital
is to be delayed 15 years, the excess of value
computed in the same manner will be 17l. 15s. 6d.—if
20 years, 19l. 1s.—if 30 years, 21l.</p>

<p>If the 3 <i>per cents.</i> had been supposed at a greater
discount, it is evident that these several values
would have been likewise greater; and had the
quantity of 4 <i>per cent.</i> stock been supposed <i>double</i>
or <i>triple</i>, the effect would have been the same with
a delay of redemption; and had it been supposed
thirty or forty millions, the effect (in consequence
of our slow progress in redeeming our debts) would
not have fallen very short of an eternal delay of
redemption.</p>

<p>Before 1749, the amount of the public debts
carrying 4 <i>per cent.</i> interest was near 58 millions.
The expectation, therefore, of the advantage
now explained could not <i>then</i> have any effect;
and the only cause which could have influenced,
in any considerable degree, the comparative
prices of these stocks must have been the first I
have assigned, or the expectation of their <i>reduction</i>;
that is, in other words, the expectation of
a <i>sudden redemption</i> of them, as soon as the 3 <i>per
cents.</i> got above <i>par</i>, by borrowing money at that
interest. Had not this been foreseen, or had there
been an act of parliament rendering it impracticable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_196" id="Page_2_196">[196]</a></span>
there is no reason to doubt but the price of
the <span class="smcapuc">FOUR</span> <i>per cents.</i> compared with the <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span> <i>per
cents.</i> would have approached nearly to the proportion
of the rates of interest, agreeably to what
is said in (<a href="#Page_2_191">page 191</a>).</p>

<p>The state of the public funds has been much
changed since the two last wars; but it is an alteration
that has increased the comparative value
of 4 <i>per cent.</i> capitals.</p>

<p>I have already observed, that during the last
war there was reason to expect, that, as soon as
peace came, the <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span> <i>per cents.</i> would rise above
<i>par</i>. No one can now entertain any such expectation.
On the contrary; it is most probable,
that they will never again rise to that which has
been their average price during the last peace from
1763 to 1775, and which, I think, may be stated
at 87 or 88.—My reason for this assertion is,</p>

<p>First, that after the present war, should we be
so happy as to escape the ruin with which it threatens
us, our taxes and expences will be so much
increased, and at the same time our resources so
much diminished, as necessarily to leave the credit
and value of our public securities lower than
ever.</p>

<p>Secondly. Though our credit and resources
should continue undiminished, yet the great addition
which the present war will make to the
public debt, is alone likely to sink their value,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_197" id="Page_2_197">[197]</a></span>
because every increase of a saleable commodity
has always a tendency to lower its price.—It
follows from hence, that the purchasers of <span class="smcapuc">FOUR</span>
<i>per cent.</i> capitals have now a prospect of an advantage
of 12 or 14 <i>per cent.</i> at redemption, which
they could not have had before the last peace.</p>

<p>In connexion with this it must be considered,
that it is now highly probable, that it will never
be again practicable to reduce the interest of any
4 <i>per cent.</i> capitals. In order to such a reduction,
government must be able to offer to the proprietors
of these capitals their <i>principal</i>, should they
not chuse to take lower interest, and consequently
to borrow at an interest of 3½ or 3¾ <i>per cent.</i> But
no sums will be lent on such lower interest, unless
it can be depended Upon that capitals bearing that
interest, when brought to market, will bear a premium
of 1 or 2 <i>per cent.</i>; and this, when the <i>three
per cents.</i> are not higher than 87 or 88, would require
the excess of value of such capitals to be
estimated at 14 or 15 <i>per cent.</i> whereas it has been
lately found, that even <span class="smcapuc">FOUR</span> <i>per cent.</i> capitals
irredeemable for ten years, will not bear such an
excess of value.—A <i>reduction</i>, therefore, of the interest
of <span class="smcapuc">FOUR</span> <i>per cent.</i> capitals, or a <i>redemption</i> of
them by borrowed money, cannot now be reckoned
upon; and the only cause that can <span class="smcapuc">REASONABLY</span>
sink their value compared with the <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span>
<i>per cents.</i> below the ratio of the rates of interest, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_198" id="Page_2_198">[198]</a></span>
the probability of a redemption of them by the
surplus of the national revenue. I need not say
how little is to be expected from hence. Supposing,
however, that much may be expected,
I have shewn what effect it ought to have; and
from the observations I have made, and particularly
the computation in (<a href="#Page_2_194">page 194</a>), &amp;c. it
appears, I think, that the price of the capital of
five millions four <i>per cent.</i> annuities lately created
ought to have been near 18 <i>per cent.</i> more than
the price of the <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span> <i>per cents.</i> This appears
to be true on the supposition that this capital will
be redeemed in fifteen years; (that is, in five years
after the expiration of the term for which it is made
irredeemable) that the 3 <i>per cents.</i> will rise to as
high a price as they bore during the last peace;
and that purchasers are allowed to make <span class="smcapuc">FOUR</span> <i>per
cent.</i> compound interest of their money.—Were
we to suppose this capital discharged even in two
years after it becomes redeemable, the value, made
out in the same way, would be nearly 17l.</p>

<p>He who will consider all this, and also recollect
the general price of the 4 <i>per cents.</i> before their reduction
in 1749, (see <a href="#Page_2_190">page 190</a>) must be convinced
that the <span class="smcap">Treasury</span>, at the time the last loan was
settled, had good reason for taking the price of the
new <i>four per cent.</i> capitals 17 <i>per cent.</i> higher than
the price of the three <i>per cents.</i>—It has, however,
been found that this was too high a valuation.
Instead of being sold at 17l. more for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_199" id="Page_2_199">[199]</a></span>
every 100l. stock than the 3 <i>per cents.</i> they have
been sold at only 13l. or 14l. more; and this has
been the chief reason of the discount to which the
last subscription fell.—It is hard to say, by what
principles the money’d men who traffic in the
funds have governed themselves in this instance;
but certain it is, that they have not been guided by
any of the rules of just calculation: And the
same must be said of the value at which they have
reckoned the short annuity of a half <i>per cent.</i> for ten
years annexed to the new 4 <i>per cents.</i> In forming
the scheme for the last loan this annuity was, I
have said, estimated at 8⅟₁₀ years purchase, agreeably
to its real value, supposing the payments yearly,
the first payment to be made at the distance of a
year, and money improved at 4 <i>per cent.</i> compound
interest. But it has in general been sold at about
7½ years purchase; which is <i>less</i> than its value,
supposing money improved at 5½ <i>per cent.</i> compound
interest.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_200" id="Page_2_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>From this account it appears, that could the
caprice of the public have been foreseen, the
price of the new four <i>per cents.</i> should not have
been reckoned at more than 91l.; (the 3 <i>per
cents.</i> being at 78l.) and that, consequently, to make
up a value which would have produced 102l. for
every 100l. advanced, either the term of irredeemableness
and of the short annuity should have
been lengthened; or, supposing this term the
same, the short annuity should have been more
than doubled. An artificial capital, indeed, of
near half a million would in this case have been
created. But this disadvantage might have been
avoided, without bringing any additional expence
on the public, by such alterations as I have before
proposed; and by increasing in the corrected
schemes, (<a href="#Page_2_186">page 186</a>), &amp;c. either the term of irredeemableness,
or the short annuity, or the rate of interest,
or all of them together.</p>

<p class="tb">The preceding account will, I fancy, help to
shew what is practicable, <i>taking things as they are</i>,
in borrowing money for public uses. It proves,
that the nation loses greatly by the low price of all
capitals bearing a higher interest than 3 <i>per cent.</i>
and that could their value be raised, it would be
greatly benefited.—For example. Could the
new <span class="smcapuc">FOUR</span> <i>per cents.</i> have been taken at 99l. for
every 100l. stock, instead of 95l. the whole expence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_201" id="Page_2_201">[201]</a></span>
of the short annuity in the scheme of the
last loan, and of a <i>quarter per cent.</i> perpetual interest,
in the corrected schemes, (<a href="#Page_2_186">page 186</a>), &amp;c. might
have been saved. But had the value of the 4 <i>per
cents.</i> been raised in proportion to the rate of interest,
or <i>nearly</i> in that proportion, a farther saving
might have been made, in all the schemes, of the
profits of the lottery, and, consequently, of 6000l.
<i>per annum</i> in the annual charge.—My next enquiry,
therefore, shall be, in what manner and by
what regulations this may be done. I have written
in the section on loans, on the supposition that
such regulations are practicable; and I have proposed
one of them; but I will here be more
explicit.</p>

<p class="tb">It has been shewn, that before 1749 the cause
which depressed the value of the 4 <i>per cents.</i> was
the expectation of their being reduced; and that
<i>now</i> this cause is the expectation of their being
soon <i>redeemed</i>. Remove, therefore, these causes
in any degree, and their value must rise in the
same degree.—With respect to the first, it is
in my opinion certain that it would be doing great
service to the public to exclude it entirely. Our
reductions of interest have proceeded from a
policy too narrow; and the nation is likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_202" id="Page_2_202">[202]</a></span>
suffer by them much more than it has gained.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
The savings they produce, being expended on
current services, tempt to extravagance; give a
fallacious appearance of opulence; and, by
making our debts sit lighter, render us less
anxious about redeeming them, and less apprehensive
of danger from the increase of them.
At the same time they render their redemption a
work of more difficulty, and oblige government,
when under a necessity of contracting new debts,
either to give extravagant interest, or to offer
extravagant premiums. That accumulation of
artificial debts which I have pointed out has
been owing principally to this cause; and had
it not been, in particular, for the reduction in
1749, the public debts would now have been
near 14 millions less; and a debt of above a hundred
millions, instead of consisting of capitals
bearing interest at 3 <i>per cent.</i> would have consisted
of capitals bearing some of them 3½, some 4, and
some 4½ and 5 <i>per cent.</i> interest, which (supposing
them all at a medium to bear 4 <i>per cent.</i>) a million
<i>per ann.</i> would have redeemed in six years less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_203" id="Page_2_203">[203]</a></span>
time, and at twenty-one millions less expence.—In
short; reducing of interest is one of those unhappy
<span class="smcapuc">TEMPORARY EXPEDIENTS</span> to which statesmen
are apt to betake themselves; and by which
<i>present</i> relief is gained at the expence of <i>future</i>
safety, and distress postponed by rendering it in the
end more unavoidable and dreadful.—There
cannot, therefore, be any sufficient reason against
making the interest of the new capitals which may
be created by any future loans, <span class="smcapuc">IRREDUCIBLE</span>.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
Should this raise the price of capitals bearing high
interest in proportion to the increase of interest,
government would be enabled to borrow to equal
advantage whatever interest it offered; the new
loans would not bring any greater annual charge
on the nation than would have been necessary had
the same sums been obtained by selling 3 <i>per cent.</i>
capitals; and, at the same time, all the immense
expence of <i>douceurs</i> and <i>fictitious capitals</i> would be
saved, and all the advantages in redeeming the
public debts obtained, arising from smaller capitals
bearing higher interest.</p>

<p>Such a regulation as that now proposed would
be alone sufficient for these purposes, when the
amount of the debts bearing high interest and declared
irreducible, is considerable, as appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_204" id="Page_2_204">[204]</a></span>
from what is said in (<a href="#Page_2_195">page 195</a>). But when a debt
happens to bear a higher interest than any other,
and is at the same time small, the probability of a
<i>quick redemption</i> will operate in the same manner
on its price with the expectation of a <i>reduction</i>;
and in this case, therefore, it will become necessary,
in order to avoid the inconveniences I have
described, to <span class="smcapuc">POSTPONE REDEMPTION</span>; and one of
the best methods of doing this will be, by ordering,
that such a debt shall be redeemed <i>after</i> some
other given part of the funded public debts.—So
slow has been our progress in redeeming debts,
that this (supposing the part to be first redeemed
considerable) would be reckoned, in the present
circumstances of the funds, the same with making
the debt to be last redeemed, irredeemable for
ever. And should such an apprehension prove
right, the public would lose nothing, because the
debt whose redemption was postponed, would
bring no greater annual charge on the public, than
if the same sum had been obtained by selling a
capital bearing any lower interest. But should it
prove false, or should our debts be ever put into
a fixed course of redemption, the public would
gain greatly by being able, after discharging one
part of its debts, to discharge the remainder more
expeditiously and easily.</p>

<p>I shall beg leave to illustrate what has been now
said by having recourse again to the last loan of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_205" id="Page_2_205">[205]</a></span>
<span class="smcapuc">FIVE MILLIONS</span>.—During the last 60 years, or
from the first establishment of the sinking fund
to the year 1777, no more than about <span class="smcapuc">FIFTEEN
MILLIONS</span> of the public funded debts have been
paid. An order, therefore, that the capital of
five millions bearing 4 <i>per cent.</i> created by the
last loan, should not be discharged unless a capital
of twenty-five or thirty millions in the three <i>per
cents.</i> shall have been <i>first</i> discharged, would have
carried its redemption to so distant a period, as
might probably have raised it to the same comparative
value with any 3 <i>per cent.</i> capitals.</p>

<p>Let it, however, be supposed to advance its
price only to 102l. when the 3 <i>per cents.</i> are at 78;
that is, when the ratio of the rates of interest required
the price to be at 104. In these circumstances,
4.850,000l. of the five millions would
have been advanced for an equal capital carrying
194,000l. interest at 4 <i>per cent.</i>; and the remaining
150,000l. would have been advanced for the lottery:
And thus the whole expence of the short annuity,
and 150,000l. capital, would have been saved.—And
had the same sum been obtained by selling a
3 <i>per cent.</i> capital, the amount of interest, though
the least possible, would not have been much less;<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_206" id="Page_2_206">[206]</a></span>
but, at redemption, there would have been a necessity
of paying above a <span class="smcapuc">MILLION AND A QUARTER</span>
for which no value had been received.—When
such advantages, uncompensated by any loss, can
be obtained by so easy and simple a regulation as
only changing the <span class="smcapuc">ORDER</span> of paying the public
debts,<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> what possible reason can there be
against adopting it?</p>

<p>There is another method by which the value of
any stocks bearing high interest might be raised,
which would probably be no less effectual; I
mean, by ordering that no part of such stocks
shall be redeemed, without at the same time
redeeming an <i>equal</i>, or any <i>larger</i> sum, in other
capitals. This is the regulation proposed in the
section on public loans, (<a href="#Page_2_98">page 98</a>); and it will not
be amiss here to give an illustration of it, by
supposing, that <span class="smcapuc">EIGHT MILLIONS</span> will be wanted
for the necessary supplies of this year; and that
this sum will be procured by selling, as was done
in the last loan, a capital equal to the sum advanced,
bearing 4 <i>per cent.</i> interest. Were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_207" id="Page_2_207">[207]</a></span>
interest in this case made irreducible, and the capital
incapable of being redeemed without at the same
time redeeming four times as much of the 3 <i>per ct.</i>
or some other stocks, an increase of value would be
communicated to it which would render all <span class="smcap">Douceurs</span>
unnecessary. For it would be a capital, the
redemption of which could not be completed
without discharging in all <span class="smcapuc">FORTY</span><a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> <span class="smcapuc">MILLIONS</span>
of the public debts.—I cannot doubt but that,
in these circumstances (supposing the price of the
3 <i>per cents.</i> to continue near 78) a 100l. in
money would be given for 100l. in such a
stock, and the whole extravagant expence of
short annuities, lotteries, and artificial capitals
would be saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_208" id="Page_2_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>In short. With the aid of such regulations as
those now proposed, <span class="smcapuc">EIGHT MILLIONS</span> might this
year be borrowed (supposing the 3 <i>per cents.</i> not
lower than 78 or 77) <i>probably</i> at an interest of 4 <i>per
cent.</i>, but <i>certainly</i> at an interest an <span class="smcapuc">EIGHTH</span> or a
<span class="smcapuc">QUARTER</span> higher, without offering any <i>premiums</i>.
Whereas, if no such regulations are established,
either an artificial debt of near<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> <i>two millions and
a half</i> must be created; or 5 <i>per cent.</i> for 15 or 20
years certain, together with the profits of a lottery,
must be given; and a new tax laid which
will produce 400,000l. <i>per ann.</i></p>

<p>It may deserve to be added, that an unprosperous
state of public affairs, and apprehensions
of public danger, would have a tendency, by
placing the redemption of our debts at a greater
distance, to promote, rather than obstruct the
success of schemes attended with such regulations.</p>

<p class="tb">There remains one proposal more on this
subject which I wish may be attended to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_209" id="Page_2_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>I have observed, that our reductions of interest
have been the effect of too narrow a policy. It
seems to me, that one of the best measures that
could now be adopted, would be to undo what
we have done in this instance, by restoring the
3 <i>per cent.</i> capitals to a higher interest, and making
this restoration, one of the means of raising
the necessary supplies. That this is practicable,
and that it would be advantageous, will appear
from the following scheme, and observations.</p>

<p>For 20l. in money, let 110l. stock bearing 3½
<i>per cent.</i> interest, be offered, in exchange for
every 100l. of the 3 <i>per cent.</i> stocks; and let the
new 3½ <i>per cent.</i> flock be capable of being redeemed
at any time, but never under <i>par</i>, unless
when the price of the 3 <i>per cents.</i> happens to be
below 85l.—By this scheme the public would
procure 20l. from the conversion of every 100l.
3 <i>per cent.</i> stock into 110l. stock carrying 3½
<i>per cent.</i>; or <span class="smcapuc">FIVE MILLIONS</span> from the conversion
of <span class="smcapuc">TWENTY-FIVE MILLIONS</span>. The new <i>additional</i>
capital would be only <span class="smcapuc">TWO MILLIONS AND A HALF</span>,
(or 10 <i>per cent.</i> of the old capital); and the <i>additional</i>
interest would be 17s. (that is, a half <i>per
cent.</i> added to 7s. the interest of 10l. at 3½ <i>per
cent.</i>) for every 20l. advanced; or 4¼ <i>per cent.</i>
for the whole loan.</p>

<p>That such a scheme would afford ample encouragement
to subscriptions, supposing the 3 <i>per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_210" id="Page_2_210">[210]</a></span>
cents.</i> at or near 78, will appear from considering,
that the interest offered is above a <i>quarter per cent.</i>
more than could be made by purchasing any
perpetual annuities, and at the same time, in consequence
of forming a part of the interest of a
<span class="smcapuc">THREE AND A HALF</span> <i>per cent.</i> capital, is incapable
of reduction, and therefore nearly on an equal
footing with the interest of any 3 <i>per cent.</i> capital.—But
to be a little more explicit.</p>

<p>The new capital of 110l. bearing 3½ <i>per cent.</i>
interest would be better than the 100l. <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span>
<i>per cent.</i> capitals for which it would be substituted,
in the following respects.—1st. It would carry
17s. <i>per ann.</i> more interest; and such an interest,
when the price of an annuity of 3l. is 78l., ought
to be worth 22l. 2s. The additional interest,
therefore, would be disposed of at 2l. 2s. for
every sum of 22l. 2s. (or at 9½ <i>per cent.</i>) less
than its true value, compared with the price of
the 3 <i>per cent.</i> annuities.</p>

<p>Secondly. The 3 <i>per cents.</i> when <i>peace</i> comes,
will probably be capable of being redeemed at
88l.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> But this stock, in the same circumstances,
must be redeemed at <i>par</i>. It will, therefore,
produce 12l. more in every 100l. at redemption.
Add the 10l. additional stock; and the whole
additional sum to be received at redemption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_211" id="Page_2_211">[211]</a></span>
will be 22l.—There will, therefore, be a profit
at redemption of 10l. <i>per cent.</i> of the money advanced;
and this profit deserves the more notice,
because the stock to which it is annexed, being redeemable
at any time, and bearing a higher interest
than the 3 <i>per cents.</i> will be selected for redemption
before them; and therefore its price
will be so much the more likely always to keep
near <i>par</i>.—Setting aside, however, this advantage,
and supposing only the 20l. advanced likely to
be received at redemption, it may be found by calculating
in the manner explained in (<a href="#Page_2_194">p. 194</a>), &amp;c.
that the substitution of 110l. flock carrying <span class="smcapuc">THREE
AND A HALF</span> <i>per cent.</i> for 100l. carrying <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span>
<i>per cent.</i>, or, in other words, that 20l. to be received
some time hereafter, besides an annuity
of 17s. for the intermediate time, is worth in
present money more than 20l., reckoning compound
interest at 4 <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p>Such a scheme, therefore, in whatever way its
value was rightly calculated, would appear to
offer an advantageous bargain. Should there,
however, be reason to fear that the public might
judge otherwise; or should the 3 <i>per cents.</i> be at
74 or 75, the value might be easily increased
near nine <i>per cent.</i> by making the substituted
stock 112l. instead of 110l. in which case, the
interest for the 20l. advanced would become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_212" id="Page_2_212">[212]</a></span>
18s. 5d. <i>per ann.</i>, or a little more than four and
a half <i>per cent.</i> instead of <i>four and a quarter</i>.</p>

<p>The advantages to the public which would
arise from such a scheme are—1st. That it
would be one of the best preparations for
measures that must some time or other be entered
into for putting the public debts into a
<i>fixed</i> course of redemption.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>—In consequence
of being raised to a higher interest, a
considerable part of them would be made capable
of being redeemed with more ease and
expedition; and for this reason, it is certain
that, if there remains a possibility of our escaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_213" id="Page_2_213">[213]</a></span>
a public bankruptcy, the time must come
when we shall wish all our debts bore a high
interest.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Secondly. A capital of <span class="smcapuc">TWO MILLIONS AND A
HALF</span> would be saved in raising <span class="smcapuc">FIVE MILLIONS</span>.
That is; the nation in procuring <i>five millions</i>
would incur a debt of only <i>half</i> that sum; and
instead of having a <span class="smcapuc">QUARTER</span> or a <span class="smcapuc">THIRD</span> <i>more</i> to
pay at redemption than had been received, it
would have <span class="smcapuc">ONE HALF</span> <i>less</i> to pay.</p>

<p>Thirdly. Such a scheme would keep up public
credit; and, by its necessary operation, contribute
to carry <i>itself</i> into execution. For the advantages
attending it being grounded entirely upon
the old 3 <i>per cent.</i> stocks, few at such a time would
chuse to sell them, but many would be induced to
buy, and, consequently, their price would be advanced,
contrary to the common effect of public
loans.—These seem to me advantages so unspeakably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_214" id="Page_2_214">[214]</a></span>
important, that I cannot but think it
would be right to go to some extraordinary expence,
in making at least one experiment of this
kind. If, in consequence of offering high terms
in <i>one</i> trial for a small sum, such an experiment
should succeed, it might be renewed on lower
terms; and the way might be discovered of managing,
in the best manner, larger loans on the same
plan.—I cannot help thinking indeed, that it
would be found that in this way great sums might
be raised without creating <i>any</i> new capitals, or
making any addition to the public debts. I fancy,
for instance, that few, when the 3 <i>per cents.</i> are
about 78, would scruple to pay 25l. for the conversion
of 100l. <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span> <i>per cent.</i> stock into a 100l.
<span class="smcapuc">FOUR</span> <i>per cent.</i> stock, provided this last stock was
not to become redeemable till <span class="smcapuc">THIRTY</span> or <span class="smcapuc">FORTY
MILLIONS</span> of our present debts have been discharged:
And supposing this true, money for public
services would be raised at 4 <i>per cent.</i> or at an
interest nearly as low as possible; and, at the same
time, a sum equal to the whole money advanced
would be saved. But were it necessary to take for
such a substitution 24l. or even 23l. (that is, to
pay about 4¼ <i>per cent.</i> for money) the gain, if our
debts are ever to be redeemed, would abundantly
overbalance the increased expence of interest.</p>

would be equal, were equal quantities issued every
year, and were there also no cause which diminished or destroyed
it, except the <i>uniform</i> operation of time in wearing it.
Any cause, therefore, which destroys it more, or diminishes it
faster at first than at last, must render the quantity less in the
first degrees of deficiency. And the same must be the consequence
of a greater proportion issued formerly, in any given
time, than of late.—The causes of diminution never probably
operated so much on the gold coin as they did for about
twelve years before 1773; and this will balance the greater
proportion coined during that time. The very reason of the
increase of coinage in those years was, a necessity created by
the loss of the new coin, and never before felt in an equal
degree. The coinage, however, in those years, was not so
much more than usual as some may imagine. In ten years
before 1770, eight millions and a half were coined; and in
twelve years after the <i>Accession</i>, the same quantity was coined;
and in twenty-seven years after the <i>Accession</i>, more was coined
than in twenty-seven years before 1770. See <i>Considerations
on Money, Bullion</i>, &amp;c. p. 2.—The whole quantity of gold
coined from the Accession to 1770, was near 29 millions;
more than one half of which must have been melted and
exported; and, the greatest part of the remainder must have
been precipitated in its progress towards deficiency by being
clipped and sweated.</p>

Its having brought in above double this sum makes
little difference. For it proves, that the whole quantity of

of computing) 21 or 22 millions; and the quantity deficient
more than a grain about 15 millions; and, consequently,

of the mint. But the reason is, that bullion alone being exportable
in any considerable quantity, the price of it must
vary as the demand for it varies; or, in other words, as the
<i>balance of payment</i> between us and the rest of the world is
favourable or unfavourable.—This will be explained at the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_92" id="Footnote_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> The paper currency of the Colonies is one of the greatest
disadvantages under which they labour; but it is of a more
safe and permanent nature than ours. Were it not so, it
could not have been of the least use to them for the last year
and a half. He who doubts this, need only consider what
our paper would be worth were we now invaded as they are.</p>

<p>This difference depends chiefly, on the following circumstances.—Their
paper is not payable on demand.—It is a
legal tender.—It represents fixed property which is mortgaged
for it.—It does not support such a monstrous debt
as ours.—And when public emergencies require any extraordinary
emissions, they are generally sunk by taxes in
four or five years.—It is the first of these circumstances that
gives our paper its currency; and it is also this circumstance
that creates the danger attending it, by rendering it incapable
of sustaining any great shock or panic.—The possession of
securities equal in nominal value to the amount of the paper
emitted, or the debts contracted, is of little consequence when
the value of these securities depends on the paper, and is created
by it; that is, in other words, when the debts themselves
are the very cash which must pay the debts.—Nothing
can be more unnatural than such a state of things; and it may
hereafter be a curious object of enquiry, how it could be ever
possible that it should subsist any long time.</p>

<p>In page 78 of the <i>Observations on Civil Liberty</i>, I have said,
“that the kingdom of <span class="smcap">France</span> has no such dependence as
we have on paper-credit; and that its specie amounts to
67 millions sterling.” In mentioning this sum I took the
lowest of different accounts which I had then received from
different authorities. I have since received accounts which
make it 87 millions and a half; or 2000 millions of <i>livres</i>.
This, in particular, is the account of an author whom all
know to be likely to be well informed on this subject; I mean
the author of the Treatise on the <i>Legislation</i> and <i>Commerce of
Corn</i>, Part I. chap. v.—In the same treatise it is said,
(Part I. chap. viii,) that it appears, from the returns made by
the intendants of the different Provinces, that the number of
<i>annual</i> deaths in the whole kingdom of France, for three
years ended in 1772, was 780,040. I have been informed
by the ingenious author, that this account may be depended
on; and if so, <i>France</i> must contain 26 millions of inhabitants;
for the best observations prove, that no more than a
thirty-third part of a whole kingdom dies annually. See Observations
on Reversionary Payments, page 200.—In <i>Sweden</i>,
though a nineteenth part die in the capital every year, only
a thirty-fifth part die in the whole kingdom. See Philosophical
Transactions, Vol. lxv. for 1775, p. 426. The
particulars now mentioned, added to the nature of the
debts of <span class="smcap">France</span> as mentioned in page 78 of the <i>Observations
on Civil Liberty</i>, form a striking contrast between
the state of that kingdom and ours. Nothing gives us our superiority
but the advantages we derive from our <span class="smcap">Religion</span>
and our <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>. Even in these respects, however, they
seem to be improving, while we are declining. <i>Montesquieu</i>,
<i>Abbe Raynal</i>, and others of their most admired writers, inculcate
principles of government, and breathe a spirit of Liberty,
which, to the shame of this country, are become offensive in it.</p>

of this society; or in supposing this society obliged to be
governed solely for the benefit of a distant country; that it
is not easy to imagine there can be any foundation for it
in justice or equity. The insisting on <i>old claims</i> and <i>tacit
conventions</i>, to extend civil power over distant nations, and
form grand unwieldy empires, without regard to the obvious
maxims of humanity, has been one great source of
human misery.” <i>System of Moral Philosophy</i>, by Dr. <span class="smcap">Hutcheson</span>,

to be, that they acquire such a right, “Whenever they are

themselves for all the good ends of a political union.”—Such
a decision given by a wise man, long before we had any
disputes with the colonies, deserves, I think, particular

increased a 16th or even an 8th <i>per cent.</i> without any material
difference; or, (which would have been better) 3½ <i>per
cent.</i> might have been offered for <i>four fifths</i> of the sum borrowed,
and 4 <i>per cent.</i> for the remainder; in which case, the
annuity payable by the public would have been 65,790l.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_100" id="Footnote_100"></a><a href="#FNanchor_100"><span class="label">[100]</span></a> It should be remembered here, that tho’ Government,
when its debts are at a discount, may be able, with the consent
of the creditors, to redeem a given capital by paying a less
sum than that capital; yet it can never be obliged to pay <i>more</i>.—In
other words; a 100l. capital in the 3 <i>per cents</i>; 3½
<i>per cents</i>; or 4, or 5 <i>per cents</i>, Government is always at liberty
to redeem by paying 100l. whatever the market price of it
may be, and whether the creditors will consent or not.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_101" id="Footnote_101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_101"><span class="label">[101]</span></a> There is another very great advantage which would attend
these annuities.—One and the same <i>surplus</i> would discharge
a given capital in less time. For example. A surplus
of a million <i>per ann.</i> invariably applied, and the first
payment to be made immediately, would discharge a capital
of a <i>hundred millions</i> bearing 3 <i>per cent.</i> interest in 46 years.
But if the same capital bore 3½ <i>per cent.</i> interest, it would
be discharged in 43½ years; if 4 <i>per cent.</i> in 40 years; if 5
<i>per cent.</i> in 37¼ years.—A capital <i>less</i> than a 100 millions,
in the same proportion that the interest is <i>more</i> than 3 <i>per cent.</i>
and for which, therefore, the same annuity is paid, (as in the
present case) the same surplus would discharge in 39 years,
if the interest is 3½; in 34¼ years, if the interest is 4 <i>per
cent.</i> in 27¼ years if the interest is 5 <i>per cent.</i>—Supposing,
therefore, 75 millions borrowed in the manner of our Government,
by creating a capital of a 100 millions bearing 3 <i>per cent.</i>
(that is, by selling 3 <i>per cent.</i> stock for 75l. in money) which might
have been borrowed by creating a capital of only 75 millions
bearing 4 <i>per cent.</i> (that is by selling 4 <i>per cent.</i> stock at 100)
there will not only be a loss of 25 millions by a needless increase
of the capital; but also a loss of 14 millions, by an
increase of the time in which one and the same saving will
discharge the two capitals.—This may be proved in the following
manner.—A million, <i>per ann.</i> will, in 34 years and a
quarter, very nearly discharge a debt of 75 millions bearing
interest at 4 <i>per cent.</i>; but the same saving will, in the same
time, discharge only a capital of 61 millions, if it bears interest
at 3 <i>per cent.</i> When, therefore, such a saving has compleated
the redemption of the <i>one</i> capital, there will remain unpaid
of the other, 39 millions.—What has been now applied to
a large sum holds true in proportion of any smaller sums.</p>

<p>It appears from hence to be a very wrong observation which
some have made; “that provided the annual charge is the same,
it signifies little what the <i>principal</i> of the public debt is.”—As
there is no way of removing the annual charge but by
paying the <i>principal</i>, it is of just as much consequence what it
is, as whether it is practicable or impracticable, to remove a
burden which weakens and cripples, and must in time sink the
public. An annuity of <span class="smcap">Six Millions</span>, if the principal is
<span class="smcap">Hundred Millions</span> borrowed at 6 <i>per cent.</i> might be redeemed
in 33 years with a million <i>per ann.</i> surplus. But if the
principal is <span class="smcap">Two Hundred Millions</span> bearing 3 <i>per cent.</i>
the same surplus would, in the same time, pay off only 56 millions;
and but little more than a <i>quarter</i> of the annuity would
be redeemed. If, therefore, the same sum might as well have
been obtained by creating a principal of a hundred millions
bearing 6 <i>per cent.</i> as by creating a capital of two hundred
millions bearing 3 <i>per cent.</i> there will be a needless expence,
in discharging the debt, of 144 millions.</p>

equal to the sum which might have been received for
the profits of the lottery.”—When the 3 <i>per cents.</i> are

gives a fallacious appearance of borrowing at 3 <i>per cent.</i> It is
the same with selling the profits of a lottery, and at the same
time absurdly converting the purchase-money into a debt due
to the purchaser.—Since the last war we have had seven
of these lotteries, including two in 1763; and above a million
has been lost by them.</p>

<p>In Queen <i>Anne</i>’s time, there were several lotteries, consisting
of all <i>prizes</i> and no <i>blanks</i>. This is so curious, and most
persons may be so much at a loss to conceive of the possibility
of it, that I cannot help explaining it.</p>

<p>A capital, equal to the whole money advanced, was distributed
<i>equally</i> among all the tickets in the lottery; and, in
order to make them prizes of different values, there was
farther distributed among them different shares of an additional
capital, to which a right was given, though no money had
been paid for it.—For example—In 1711, two millions
were raised by a lottery of this kind, called a class
lottery. The whole sum advanced was divided into 20,000
tickets, each 100<i>l.</i> stock bearing 6 <i>per cent.</i> interest. This
capital was increased by a gratuitous capital of 602,200<i>l.</i>
bearing the same interest, and divided into shares which
were added to the tickets, in order to form prizes.—This
was the same with giving near 8 <i>per cent.</i> for money, besides a
<i>premium</i> of 30 <i>per cent.</i>—As the interest of money was at
this time 6 <i>per cent.</i> the sum borrowed would most certainly
have been advanced at 8 <i>per cent.</i> without any <i>premium</i>; but
it was, I suppose, reckoned necessary that government should
not <i>seem</i> to give such high interest.—In the same year,
1.500,000<i>l.</i> was borrowed by another such lottery, and creating
a capital of 1.928,570<i>l.</i> And in 1712, 3.600,000<i>l.</i> was borrowed
by two more such lotteries, and creating a capital of
4.683,080<i>l.</i>—The greatest part of the debts contracted by
these lotteries (amounting to 9.213,850<i>l.</i> though only
7.100,000<i>l.</i> was advanced) remains at this hour an incumbrance
on the public; and the duties constituting the <i>general
fund</i> are charged with the interest of it.</p>

<p>In 1714, the national interest was reduced to 5 <i>per cent.</i>
But in that very year 1.400,000<i>l.</i> was borrowed by a lottery,
which gave a right to a capital of 1.876,000<i>l.</i> bearing 4 <i>per
cent.</i> that is, by giving near 5½ <i>per cent.</i> interest, besides a
<i>premium</i> of 34 <i>per cent.</i>—Thus have our debts been increased.
But even worse has been done. The taxes charged with the
interest of the public debts proving often deficient, the shortest
way of discharging the arrears has been often taken, by
adding them to the principal, and paying <i>compound</i> interest for
money.—Is it a wonder, that a nation which has been so
careless in contracting debts, should have done so little towards
discharging them?</p>

not be glad to lend to government on any higher interest than
that which he can make in the funds. There is no one, for
instance, who would not be glad to lend 75<i>l.</i> at 4 <i>per cent.</i>
when the 3 <i>per cents.</i> are at 76, and when, therefore, he cannot
make 4 <i>per cent.</i> by purchasing them.</p>

have gone along, demonstrate that the same loans would have
been made without any such expectation.</p>

of the <span class="smcap">Customs</span>, therefore, has been given rather too
high.</p>

<p>The produce of the <span class="smcap">Excises</span> in England has been higher, in

average of any three successive years, or of all the five years
since 1770, will not differ much from the sum I have given.—In
1754, or the year before the last war, the <span class="smcap">Customs</span> produced
only 1.558,254l.—The Excises, exclusive of the
Malt-tax, produced 2.819,702l,—And the whole revenue,
exclusive of the Malt-tax and Land-tax at 2s. was 5.097,617l.—In
1753 the whole revenue was 5.189,745l. And the
appropriation or annual charge upon it, (consisting of the
Civil List, 834,443l. interest of the national debt, exclusive of
navy debt, 2.628,087l. expences of management, 43,691l.

the Clergy 13,597l. &amp;c. &amp;c.) was 3.733,713l. The Sinking-Fund,
therefore, produced 1.456,000l.; which, added to
1.500,000l. (the neat produce, at that time, of Land at 2s.
and Malt-tax) made the unappropriated revenue 2.956,032l.—The
expence of the peace establishment, consisting of 10,000
seamen, and 18,857 landmen, was, in 1753 and 1754, (including
an allowance for the increase of the Navy-debt)
2.400,000l. nearly; which left an annual surplus in the national
income of 556,000l. <i>without</i> lotteries, and land at 2s.
This surplus (with land at 3s.) has of late scarcely exceeded
300,000l.; and, therefore, has not been a <span class="smcapuc">THIRD</span> of what it

of this, they have in general during the whole peace kept
12 or 13 <i>per cent.</i> below <i>par</i>, and 15 or 16 <i>per cent.</i> below the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_144" id="Footnote_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_144"><span class="label">[144]</span></a> What is here said has been verified, in the particular
instance of a <i>million and a half</i> borrowed in 1756, which was
to carry 3½ <i>per cent.</i> interest till 1771, and then to become redeemable.—During
the last war, and for about three years
after the commencement of peace, there was a general expectation
that the <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span> <i>per cents.</i> would rise above <i>par</i> as
they had done in the former peace; and while this expectation
continued, this stock reckoned no better than a <span class="smcapuc">THREE</span> <i>per
cent.</i> stock with a short annuity of a <i>half per cent.</i> annexed;
and for this reason it bore, during that period, a lower price
than another stock of 4 millions and a half which was to
bear the same interest till 1782, and then to become redeemable,
and to sink to an interest of 3 <i>per cent.</i>—In the latter
end of 1767 and beginning of 1768 the price of the former
stock rose above that of the latter, and continued not far
from <i>par</i> from that time to the time of its redemption in 1771.
The reason must have been, that being a small stock bearing
a higher interest than the other stocks, it was expected, that
it would be paid off at <i>par</i>, and therefore with a considerable
profit, as soon as it became redeemable; which accordingly
happened. See Postscript, (<a href="#Page_2_177">page 177</a>).</p>

<i>Annuities on lives</i>. They have been always granted, very unreasonably,
without any limitation of age; and their value
has been taken at no more than 12 or 13 years purchase; tho’
really worth one with another 16 or 17 years purchase. This
is a strong reason for preferring short annuities to them in all
schemes for raising money. Short annuities for 21 years will
be taken for as much as life-annuities; and yet experience has
proved that in this time not a <i>quarter</i> of the life-annuities will

will not be removed in less than 70 or 80 years. See Note 15,

<p><a name="Footnote_146" id="Footnote_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_146"><span class="label">[146]</span></a> I would except here the first reduction in 1717. This
was then necessary to gain a fund for sinking the public
debts; and had the fund thus gained been applied, as the
laws required, invariably to this purpose, and all farther reductions
been avoided, we should now have been burthened
with no debts.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_147" id="Footnote_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147"><span class="label">[147]</span></a> That is; never capable of being redeemed by substituting

by accepting lower interest.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_148" id="Footnote_148"></a><a href="#FNanchor_148"><span class="label">[148]</span></a> Supposing the 3 <i>per cents.</i> sold at 76½, the capital necessary
to produce 4.850,000l. in money would be 6.339,869l.
the interest of which at 3 <i>per cent.</i> is 190,195l.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_149" id="Footnote_149"></a><a href="#FNanchor_149"><span class="label">[149]</span></a> When the amount of interest, payable for a sum obtained
by selling a 4 <i>per cent.</i> capital, is the same with the
amount of interest, payable for an equal sum obtained by selling
a 3 <i>per cent.</i> capital, which is nearly the present case,
postponing, in the manner I have proposed, the redemption of
the former, becomes as indifferent as it would be to postpone
in the same manner the redemption of any 3 <i>per cents.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_150" id="Footnote_150"></a><a href="#FNanchor_150"><span class="label">[150]</span></a> In this case only a <span class="smcapuc">FIFTH</span> of the <i>surplus</i> to be at any
time employed in redeeming debts could be applied to the
redemption of this <i>particular</i> loan. The rest after nine
years might be employed in redeeming the 4 <i>per cent.</i> stock
created last year; or jointly with it, such parts of future
loans bearing high interest, as, in borrowing on the same plan,
might be left redeemable. And thus no obligation would
arise from this mode of borrowing to prefer the redemption
of 3 <i>per cents.</i> to the redemption of capitals bearing higher
interest. In particular; had this been the plan of borrowing
through the last war, all surplus monies might have been
ever since employed intirely in paying off 4, 4½ and 5 <i>per cent.</i>
capitals preferably to any others; and at the same time, no
<i>douceurs</i> would have been granted in order to procure the loans,
no artificial debt contracted, or extraordinary charge incurred.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_151" id="Footnote_151"></a><a href="#FNanchor_151"><span class="label">[151]</span></a> Should this be disregarded, and a long annuity offered,
as a <i>douceur</i>, of 1½ <i>per cent.</i> for 90 or 100 years, <i>eight millions</i>
might perhaps be borrowed at an interest, including the long
annuity, of 4½ <i>per cent.</i> even though the 3 <i>per cents.</i> should fall
as low as 73.—And this, probably, would be the very scheme
a minister would prefer, who, minding chiefly present ease,
did not care how much he burdened the nation hereafter.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_152" id="Footnote_152"></a><a href="#FNanchor_152"><span class="label">[152]</span></a> In 1774, a million of the 3 <i>per cents.</i> was redeemed at
this price; and in 1772, a million and a half at 90.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_153" id="Footnote_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_153"><span class="label">[153]</span></a> I mean such a course of redemption as should not
be liable to interruption by a <span class="smcapuc">WAR</span>; or, as would be the
effect of the establishment of such an unalienable <i>sinking</i>
fund as has been described in the <i>Appeal to the Public on
the Subject of the National Debt</i>, and the <i>Observations on
reversionary Payments</i>.—Nothing can save us from bankruptcy
but such a fund; and were it established, the 3
<i>per cents.</i>, when they came to be redeemed, would soon
rise to <i>par</i>; and, consequently, the obligation implied in
this scheme to pay a part of them at <i>par</i> would occasion no
additional expence. It is, however, so little to be expected,
that such a fund will be ever established, that it would
have been folly to have made the calculation given above,
on any supposition less favourable, than that the 3 <i>per cents.</i>
will bear the same price after the present war, that they
bore after the last; and that we shall go on as we have
hitherto done, paying off a <i>million</i>, or a <i>million and a half</i>,
now and then in a time of peace.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_154" id="Footnote_154"></a><a href="#FNanchor_154"><span class="label">[154]</span></a> The conversion of a 3 <i>per cent.</i> stock into a 3½ <i>per cent.</i>
stock gives the same advantage in redeeming it, that the
power of redeeming it at 85¾ for every 100l. would
give.—A million <i>per ann.</i> surplus would redeem 114 millions
and a quarter of the latter stock in the same time, and
therefore at the same expence, that it would redeem 100 millions
of the former. I suppose here the 3 <i>per cents.</i> paid at
<i>par</i>; and this I have before observed will be found to be necessary
should a time (scarcely the object of hope) ever come
when government will set itself in earnest and with any effect
to pay the public debts.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
